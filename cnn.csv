The reporter was released later that night after posting bond, McLaughlin said. Lambert is scheduled to be arraigned on February 23, according to Columbiana County online court records.During Wednesday's news conference in an East Palestine school gymnasium, Lambert was told to stop broadcasting because he was delivering his report loudly while Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was speaking, East Palestine police said in a news release. At the event, officials were announcing they were lifting a multi-day evacuation order near the site of a fiery weekend train derailment in that eastern Ohio town. The governor later said he did not ask that Lambert stop the broadcast, wasn't aware of the arrest as it happened, and affirmed journalists' right to report during the event.The body camera footage, which begins with no audio, shows Ohio National Guard's adjutant general, Maj. Gen. John Harris, speaking to Lambert's cameraman apparently while the reporter is delivering his live report. A state trooper then walks behind the camera and motions for Lambert to stop speaking.After Lambert ends his report, he turns to Harris, the video shows. The camera's view then pivots away from the pair for a few seconds, making what happened during that time unclear. When it turns back to Lambert and Harris, they appear to be arguing, but there still is no audio.Harris then puts his hand on Lambert's chest and pushes him, and the pair point at each other and appear to be speaking heatedly, the video shows. Police said Harris told them that he pushed Lambert because the reporter was coming towards him ""in an aggressive manner"" he was ""feeling threatened,"" the police release said. A few seconds after the push, the footage's audio begins as a trooper tries to get Harris to stop interacting with Lambert. ""I am allowed to be here,"" Lambert says as a deputy grabs his arm and tries to direct him out of the gym, the footage shows. ""You were told to shut it down. You continued to argue,"" says McLaughlin, who is among several law enforcement members who have begun to gather around. ""Go, now, or you can go to jail."" The sheriff and other officers repeatedly ask Lambert to leave the gym, while at least one person off-camera repeatedly asks if he could talk to Lambert outside, the footage shows. Lambert says, ""I'm going to listen (to the news conference) because it's my job,"" but the officers block him from walking toward it. A man who identifies himself as the building supervisor also asks Lambert to leave.Two officers then grab Lambert by the arms, and drag him out of the gym into an entrance hall. In their statement, East Palestine police accused Lambert of trying to pull away from officers.A struggle ensues in the hall as the officers push the reporter to the ground and handcuff him, the video shows. Lambert is then escorted to a patrol car. CNN has sought comment from the Ohio Adjutant General's Department but did not immediately hear back. ""We never want to lose sight of the fact that Evan (Lambert) was in Ohio to provide up-to-the-minute reporting about a tragic train accident that has impacted thousands of lives,"" NewsNation Washington Bureau Chief Mike Viqueira said Thursday. ""Evan handled this unfortunate situation with true professionalism, and we appreciate his commitment as a journalist whose goal is to report stories that are fair and unbiased.""Videos 'speak for themselves,' NewsNation saysMichael Corn, the president of news at NewsNation, said in a Twitter statement Thursday that the ""many videos of this incident taken by bystanders speak for themselves."" ""We will let people draw their own conclusions about how this incident was handled by the officers involved,"" Corn continued. Video provided by NewsNation Wednesday also captured portions of the argument and Lambert's arrest in which Lambert can be heard clearly identifying himself as a reporter.DeWine told reporters he did not see the arrest happen. He later was told that a reporter was asked to end his broadcast because ""the volume of his reporting was perceived to be interfering with the event,"" his office said in a statement.When reporters asked DeWine about the arrest at the end of the news conference, he said it is common practice for journalists to report live from his events and insisted they have a right to do so.""That person had a right to be reporting. They should have been allowed to report,"" he said. ""If they were in any way hampered from reporting, that certainly is wrong and it's not anything that I approve of. In fact, I vehemently disapprove of it.""Lambert told NewsNation after his release that he was ""just trying to do his job."" ""And that's what it's all about -- protecting the First Amendment and democracy and trying to help people get information,"" he said. "
1,"A handful of 'miracle' rescues, but hopes dim more than four days after quake",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html,"A lucky few are still being pulled alive from the rubble: two teenage sisters were rescued from debris in Kahramanmaraş city 101 hours after the massive earthquake hit Turkey. Ayfer, 15, was rescued in the 99th hour after the quake, as rescuers calmed her by playing her music and promising her ice cream. Her sister, Fatma, 13, was saved two hours later in a 10-hour rescue operation after seismic sensors detected signs of life under the debris.And on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, five days -- approximately 102 hours -- after the 7.8-magnitude quake struck, rescue workers managed to pull out a family of six, including two parents and their four children, from their collapsed first floor home in the city of Iskenderun.But more than four days on, and as temperatures plummet in both countries, hopes of finding loved ones are dimming, and the reality of grief and shock is setting in for the thousands left displaced across both countries.  Warnings of 'catastrophe on top of catastrophe'Although they could be considered the lucky ones, a grim reality is setting in for those left alive.Survivors could face ""a secondary disaster"" as cold and snow lead to ""worsening and horrific conditions,"" the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned Thursday, as affected areas in both countries face colder than normal temperatures. For example, the Syrian city of Aleppo is forecast to have lows of -3°C to -2°C (27°F to 28°F) through this weekend, whereas February lows are normally 2.5°C (36°F).Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, WHO incident response manager Robert Holden warned there were ""a lot of people"" surviving ""out in the open, in worsening and horrific conditions.""""We've got major disruptions to basic water supplies, we've got major disruption to fuel, electricity supplies, communication supplies, the basics of life,"" Holden said.""We are in real danger of seeing a secondary disaster which may cause harm to more people than the initial disaster if we don't move with the same pace and intensity as we are doing on the search and rescue side,"" Holden added.In Syria, the earthquake's devastation is heaping misery on top of an existing humanitarian crisis resulting from a more than decade-long civil war.  The delivery of urgent supplies to the country's quake-hit northern areas has been complicated by a long-running civil war between opposition forces and the Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of killing his own people.Many Western nations have refused to send aid directly to the Syrian regime, which is under US and EU sanctions, and Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad says any aid it receives must go through the capital Damascus, leaving rebel-held areas reliant on aid groups including the UN.Millions living in northwest Syria, much of which is controlled by anti-government rebels, were already suffering from the effects of extreme poverty and a cholera outbreak when the quake hit. Now, they are left fending for themselves, with the first UN aid convoy from Turkey into northwestern Syria arriving Thursday, days after the initial quake, followed by a second on Friday, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  In the past aid was brought into northwest Syria through Turkey from Bab al-Hawa crossing -- the only point of entry authorized by the UN Security Council. A resolution proposing more border openings between Turkey and Syria was vetoed by Russia and China.The other path in was through ""crosslines,"" aid coming in from Syrian government territory into the rebel-held northwest.The World Food Programme (WFP) is calling for more access to Syrian territories impacted to replenish aid supplies that have been exhausted, with the organization's executive director calling the situation in the northwest of the country ""catastrophe on top of catastrophe.""""The one crossing authorized by the Security Council has been re-opened, but damage to roads and slowed customs clearances are significantly hampering movement,"" World Food Programme executive director David Beasley told CNN.""What stocks we have are being exhausted quickly, especially the ready to eat rations, and they need to be replenished quickly. To do this, we need access,"" Beasley added."

3,Super Bowl ad slams Tesla's 'Full Self-Driving' tech,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/business/super-bowl-ad-tesla-full-self-driving/index.html,"The commercial, which will be aired in Washington, DC, Austin, Tallahassee, Albany, Atlanta and Sacramento does not paint Tesla in the best light. The ad is part of a multimillion dollar advertising campaign by The Dawn Project. Its founder, Dan O'Dowd, is a California tech CEO who has dedicated millions of his own money (and a failed US Senate race) to the cause.The ad cost $598,000, a Dawn Project spokesperson told CNN.It shows a Tesla Model 3, which allegedly has the Full Self-Driving mode turned on, running over a child-sized dummy on a school crosswalk, and then a fake baby in a stroller, in a series of tests by the Dawn Project. In the ad, the car swerves into oncoming traffic, zooms past stopped school buses, and cruises through ""do not enter"" signs.""Tesla's Full Self-Driving is endangering the public,"" the ad said. ""With deceptive marketing and woefully inept engineering.""The Dawn Project says it wants to make computer-controlled systems safer for humanity, shooting its own videos as tests of Tesla's alleged design flaws. In August, O'Dowd published a video showing a Tesla plowing into child-sized mannequins. Some Tesla fans posted their own videos in defense, using their own dummies or even their own children -- YouTube has taken down several test videos involving actual children, citing safety risks.O'Dowd received a cease and desist letter from Tesla over the video, claiming he and the Dawn Project were ""disparaging Tesla's commercial interests and disseminating defamatory information to the public.""O'Dowd responded to the cease-and-desist with a 1,736-word post in which he pushed back at the suggestion his posts were defamatory, defended his tests and returned barbs from Musk and some Tesla supporters.O'Dowd, who sold software to the military, is undertaking a campaign of millions of dollars to ban Tesla's Full Self-Driving feature. He is running national ads and posting online videos displaying the possible dangers of Musk's technology. He also ran an unsuccessful one-issue campaign for the US Senate on the same message.Though officially in beta mode, Full Self-Driving is available to any user in North America who wants to purchase the $15,000 feature.Tesla did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" system is intended to someday work on city streets, but despite its wide rollout, is still officially in a developmental ""beta"" program. No car for sale on the market is yet able to drive itself.Autopilot is a suite of driver-assist features, while Full Self-Driving steers the car on city streets, but could also stop for traffic signals and make turns.Tesla contends it is not aware of any ongoing government investigation that has concluded any wrongdoing occurred, and said its Autopilot, with its automated steering designed to keep a car within a lane, is safer than normal driving.""Tesla's reckless deployment of Full Self-Driving software on public roads is a major threat to public safety. Elon Musk has released software that will run down children in school crosswalks, swerve into oncoming traffic and hit a baby in a stroller to all Tesla owners in North America,"" O'Dowd said in a statement.Tesla said it ""has received requests from the Department of Justice for documents related to Tesla's Autopilot and FSD features"" in a January 31 public filing. Federal investigators are looking into a Musk tweet about disabling driver alerts on Tesla's ""Full Self Driving"" driver assist system, joining several other National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probes.On December 31, Musk replied to a tweet by @WholeMarsBlog which said ""users with more than 10,000 miles on FSD Beta should be given the option to turn off the steering wheel nag.""""Agreed, update coming in Jan,"" Musk replied.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced last summer it was escalating its Tesla probe to an ""engineering analysis,"" a step toward seeking a recall. NHTSA first investigated Tesla's driver-assist technology after reports Autopilot-engaged vehicles were crashing into emergency vehicles stopped at the scene of earlier crashes.O'Dowd is the founder and CEO of Green Hills Software. Some of Musk's defenders claim O'Dowd has a conflict of interest as one of its customers is Intel-owned Mobileye, which makes a computer chip to run driver-assisted software, the Washington Post reported.O'Dowd told the Washington Post Mobileye is one of his hundreds of customers and that his main motivation is safety."
4,DeSantis push for more control of Disney special district gets approval from Florida legislature,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/disney-ron-desantis-reedy-creek-florida/index.html,"The GOP-led state Senate voted 26-9 Friday on a bill to let the state take over the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the government body that has given Disney unique powers in Central Florida for more than half a century. Under the bill, the district's existing board will be replaced by a five-member board hand-picked by DeSantis.The measure passed the Republican-controlled House on an 82-31 vote Thursday. It now heads to the desk of DeSantis, who is expected to sign it. The latest move against Disney comes a year after the company spoke out against a bill to restrict certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity. The legislation drew a forceful rebuke from Democrats and LGBTQ advocates, who feared the bill would marginalize LGBTQ students and teachers and make them feel less safe in schools. In March of last year, as outrage against the legislation spread nationwide, Disney released a statement vowing to help get the law repealed or struck down by the courts and saying the company was ""dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.""After signing the bill into law, DeSantis then set his sights on punishing Disney. He called on lawmakers to strip the company of its special governing powers, which they did in a special session last year, voting to dissolve the Reedy Creek Improvement District at the end of May 2023.Lawmakers, though, changed course this week and instead voted on a new future for Reedy Creek, one that puts DeSantis appointees in charge of the district's long-standing powers to tax, build and borrow money for projects around Disney's vast footprint in Orange and Osceola counties. It also renames Reedy Creek as the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.Proponents say the changes ensure that there will not be a disruption to the district's existing debt or contracts. The final page of the 189-page bill states: ""The Reedy Creek Improvement District is not dissolved as of June 1, 2023, but continues in full force and effect under its new name."" The changes seemed to satisfy some concerns that the district's outstanding debt, reported at about $1 billion, would fall on Florida taxpayers. Fitch Ratings, which put Reedy Creek Improvement District's debt on watch for a negative bond rating, told CNN in a statement that the proposed legislation ""appears to address key uncertainties.""In a statement to CNN earlier this week, Jeff Vahle, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, said the company is ""monitoring the progression of the draft legislation, which is complex given the long history of the Reedy Creek Improvement District.""""Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world, and regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year,"" Vahle said."
5,December consumer prices didn't actually fall,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/economy/cpi-revisions-december-inflation/index.html,"The newly calibrated Consumer Price Index shows that prices rose 0.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in December from November versus a previously estimated decline of 0.1%.Every year, the BLS recalculates seasonal adjustment factors for CPI going back five years. (However, the year-over-year data, which is not seasonally adjusted, is not revised.) The latest annual adjustments show slight shifts in the month-on-month inflation trend for 2022 — with November and October revised up by 0.1 percentage points. Core CPI, which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy, saw upward revisions of 0.1 percentage points in December and November to 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.""Whether you're talking about inflation, labor markets, GDP, these things all go through seasonal adjustment procedures and do get revised over time,"" said Andrew Patterson, senior economist in Vanguard's investment strategy group.""There's not usually a whole lot of focus on it, but given the magnitude of inflation and the volatility of macro fundamentals these days, it's probably gotten a little bit more attention than typical,"" he added.One of many data pointsThe latest BLS tweaks show the importance of not reading into any one data point but instead reviewing a variety of different metrics over a longer-term period, he said, a point that has been repeatedly stressed by officials such as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as they measure the path of inflation. But the revisions don't change the overall storyline, Patterson noted. ""We continue to believe that inflation is going to grind down over the course of the year,"" he said. The annual revisions also come just days before the release of the January CPI report, which will debut some modifications of its own: changing its weighting methodology from consumption patterns collected every two years to a single year of spending data.""This means that this 2023 CPI report will be based on consumer spending patterns that took place in 2021, as opposed to 2022's CPI data, which was based on spending data over 2019-2020,"" William Blair analyst Richard de Chazal wrote in a note Friday. ""From the BLS's perspective, this makes the data more timely and relevant, and a better reflection of actual spending patterns.""The adjustments could help better gauge economic activity during what's been a very unpredictable time, noted Diane Swonk, KPMG chief economist, in a Twitter thread this week.""The U.S. statistical agencies work extremely hard to measure and seasonally adjust the data accurately to reflect what where once considered normal season variations — everything from the surge in extreme weather events we are enduring to the unusual dynamics of an economy that is still emerging from a pandemic have distorted normal seasonal patterns,"" she wrote.""Those shifts, coupled with the rapid pace at which the economy is currently shifting has made measuring current economic conditions more difficult. It is hard to tell where we are, let alone where the economy is headed,"" she said.Here's how the adjusted data looks for 2022:Month: Original data vs. RevisedJanuary: 0.6% vs. 0.6%February: 0.8% vs. 0.7%March: 1.2% vs. 1%April: 0.3% vs. 0.4%May: 1% vs. 0.9%June: 1.3% vs. 1.2%July: 0.1% vs. 0%August: 0.1% vs. 0.2%September: 0.4% vs. 0.4%October: 0.4% vs. 0.5%November: 0.1% vs. 0.2%December: -0.1% vs. 0.1%"
6,Lake Champlain ice fishing tournament canceled after 3 fishermen die due to thin lake ice,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/weather/vermont-lake-champlain-ice-fishing-deaths/index.html,"Wayne Alexander from Grand Isle, Vermont, died Thursday after falling through the ice, according to a release from Vermont State Police. The 62-year-old's body was found in the water hours after he was expected to return home. His truck was found at the park's entrance. On Saturday, two brothers died after their utility vehicle broke through the ice, police said.  John Fleury, 71, of Williamstown, was pulled from the water and later died in an area hospital. His brother, Wayne Fleury, 88, of East Montpelier, was located inside the vehicle by a diver from Colchester Technical Rescue and was pronounced dead on the scene, according to an updated police release.  Gilbert Gagner, a member of the Islands Ice Fishing Derby committee, told CNN this was the tournament's 43rd year and his 25th involved with it.The derby raises money for conservation on Lake Champlain. The community looks forward to February for the ice fishing, Gagner told CNN. Gagner owns Martin's General Store, which rents out ice fishing equipment. But due to unusually high temperatures this winter, Gagner told CNN he's not going back on the ice and is shutting down the rental operation.""I've never seen anything like this,"" Gagner said. ""This is craziness.""  While the fishermen who died were not affiliated with the tournament, Gagner said there was no choice but to shut it down.In a Facebook post on Saturday, the National Weather Service Burlington said ice thickness on area lakes and ponds is highly variable due to ""well above normal temperatures"" in the region over the past two months.  This year, Montpelier recorded its warmest January since 1948, with Burlington recording its fifth warmest January since 1884, NWS Burlington said on Facebook.  In a Facebook comment on a February 6 video post, NWS Burlington said if it weren't for the record-setting cold front and that hit the Northeast earlier this month, there would likely be little ice on Lake Champlain.  ""Most years this is about the time ice typically forms on the lake, though it can be quite variable. If it weren't for the last week of temps there would likely be little ice, and the next 2 weeks is looking warm with several days of wind,"" NWS Burlington said.Gagner said ice in areas of the lake that recently froze over can be misleading and look deceptively thick.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ice 6 inches thick or more can support snowmobiles or ATVs. Ice must be at least 9 inches thick to support cars and 12 inches to support medium sized trucks.  Gagner said there's about 7 to 11 inches of ice, which is not good enough in certain areas of the lake to support trailers for the tournament.  CNN affiliate WCAX reported that Vermont Fish and Wildlife was advising the public to stay off Lake Champlain.""We really want to encourage people to not go out on the ice. Clearly it's not safe. This is the second event we've had in two days. So ice safety is the most important thing,"" commissioner Christopher Herrick told WCAX."
7,New Jersey school superintendent resigns after 14-year-old student's suicide,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/us/new-jersey-teen-suicide-after-violent-attack/index.html,"Four students at Central Regional High School in Berkeley Township, located in Ocean County, New Jersey, have been charged in connection with the attack, according to prosecutors. The incident has sparked outrage among students and parents who say it reflects a culture of bullying in the district.   Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her home in Bayville, New Jersey on February 3, her father told CNN. She was assaulted on February 1 at the high school, prosecutors say. Michael Kuch believes his daughter died late at night on February 2, shortly after she sent her last text message at 10:46 p.m., he said.Triantafillos Parlapanides, the superintendent at Central Regional School District and Seaside Heights, resigned from his post on Saturday, effective immediately, the district said in a statement on its website. His resignation came amid parents and students calling on the district to improve how it handles allegations of bullying. ""The Central Regional School District is evaluating all current and past allegations of bullying. The District has contacted the Department of Education and will undergo an independent assessment of the District's anti-bullying policies and ensure every necessary safeguard is in place to protect our students and staff,"" the district's statement reads.The school district did not elaborate on any further details regarding Parlapanides's resignation. CNN has contacted Parlapanides for comment but did not hear back. One of the teenagers allegedly involved in the attack is charged with aggravated assault, two are facing charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and a fourth is charged with harassment, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said in a statement to CNN on Friday. Billhimer did not identify the students but noted prosecutors were ""precluded from releasing certain information due to the persons involved being juveniles.""   The attack on Adriana, who was walking with her boyfriend in the hallway at the time, was recorded on video and posted later that same day on social media platforms, including TikTok, which prompted a slew of hateful comments and online bullying that Kuch said drove his daughter to take her own life. The video, obtained and reviewed by CNN, shows the freshman student being hit in the face with a water bottle several times. The footage shows Adriana was punched, kicked and her hair was pulled. Kuch says his daughter suffered bruising and blacked out for a short time as a result of the attack.   Kuch has accused the school district of mishandling the attack. He says police should have been notified immediately and that his daughter should have been taken to the hospital. ""I want this to stop happening to other kids,"" Kuch said. ""This isn't just my daughter. A lot of kids are facing this at school."" John Galifi, a father of two children at the high school, told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that other children at the school have also dealt with serious bullying.  ""We are always hearing stories as parents, and it's usually overlooked by a lot of people,"" Galfi told News 12.  Dozens of students at the school staged a walkout on Wednesday, joining Kuch in demanding that the district take stronger action to hold bullies accountable.  Parlapanides confirmed to CNN that Adriana was treated by the school nurse after the attack. The former superintendent also said the four girls allegedly involved in the attack were suspended immediately ""starting that day"" and claimed the school did ""notify"" police the day of the February 1 incident.   ""We don't always press charges which are based on each individual case,"" Parlapanides said. ""We always call and notify the police of all incidents. Adriana had several cuts and bruises.""   Kuch disputes the superintendent's account and claims three of the girls involved were back at school the following day. He also claims the school did not file a police report with the Berkeley Township Police Department.  The department told CNN in a statement that ""all information and releases about this case are being handled by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office.""   CNN has contacted the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office to confirm whether the girls returned to school after their suspensions and whether school officials filed a police report after the February 1 attack. Father says he filed police report On February 1, Adriana called her father and told him that she had been ""jumped,"" Kuch said. He says he rushed to the school and was informed by school officials that his daughter had been attacked but said he wasn't given details about the incident, including that multiple girls were allegedly involved and that his daughter was hit with a water bottle. After meeting with school officials, Kuch said he took Adriana to the police station and filed a report. He said before the school day was over, the video was already making the rounds on TikTok.   Adriana shared the video with her father shortly after it was posted, along with threatening messages she received online, he contended. Kuch said he immediately contacted the school and police and shared the footage and messages.  The following day, February 2, Adriana stayed home from school due to her injuries, her father said. The last time Kuch saw his daughter was around 10 p.m. that night on footage from one of the security cameras in the family's house. The next morning, Adriana's stepmother and Kuch found her dead in her room and called 911, Kuch said.   ""You're never supposed to see your kids like that,"" Kuch said.   Adriana should be remembered as 'fun-loving,' family says Bre Cullson, one of Adriana's friends, told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey, ""I never knew how far it was going, but I know her and one of the girls were going at it for a while and she was getting threatened."" In a Facebook post on February 8, Kuch wrote, ""I want the entire world to know what these animals did to my daughter. I will not sleep until their family has to watch them stand in front of a judge and plead guilty.""  Parlapanides informed parents and guardians of Adriana's death in a letter on February 6, saying the district crisis team was ""immediately activated to meet with students and staff during this difficult time.""  ""Please know that you are never alone in this world and there is always support during bad times to help change things for the better,"" the superintendent added.  The four minors accused in the attack and their guardians were served with charges and have been released ""pending future court appearances,"" according to Billhimer, the Ocean County prosecutor.   Billhimer said he spoke with protestors at the school on Wednesday and offered to meet with them to hear their concerns. He said he also met with Parlapanides Friday morning to ""discuss ways to improve the district's response to incidents within the school.""   ""I also shared some suggestions regarding staff changes as well as programming and services to respond to the needs of the students,"" Billhimer added.  Adriana's sister-in-law, Jennifer Ferro, told CNN in an interview that the family does not want people to remember Adriana ""as the girl who sadly passed away at the age of 14.""   ""We want everyone to remember her as the fun-loving little girl we always loved being around,"" Ferro said. ""We don't want people to remember her from how she died, more who she was as a person.""

The camera zoomed in on framed printouts of the ape cartoons. ""We're both apes,"" Fallon said. Hilton, with her signature vocal fry, replied, ""Love it.""""The Tonight Show"" episode from January 2022 is a YouTube time capsule showing the temporary alliance between celebrity marketing and the crypto industry. Bored Ape Yacht Club was not the biggest crypto phenomenon, but it was one of the top beneficiaries of celebrity hype. That celebrity hype, in turn, helped draw new consumers to crypto — an industry rife with manipulation and fraud, and one that US regulators are now giving more scrutiny in the wake of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. But for a time, when crypto's prices seemed to have no limit, the money appeared too good for some to ask questions — questions like: Why are some of those apes wearing prison clothes?""That was a very significant moment, because the audience for that show is very different from the typical crypto person,"" explained Molly White, a software engineer and a fellow at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. The Bored Apes — a computer-generated collection of 10,000 cartoons — were being presented as a status symbol, membership in an exclusive club. Hilton, Fallon, and other celebrities had joined — and viewers could join, too, if they bought an NFT. A class action lawsuit, filed in December, alleges Hilton, Fallon, and other celebrities conspired in a ""vast scheme"" to artificially inflate the price of Bored Ape NFTs and enrich themselves, the crypto payments company they used to get the apes, MoonPay, and the company that made the Bored Apes, Yuga Labs. Hilton and Fallon did not respond to requests for comment.Rise of the apesIn April 2021, Yuga Labs released the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection of cartoon apes with a computer-generated combination of features and accessories, such as gold fur, a sailor hat, laser eyes, 3-D glasses, a cigarette, as well as ""hip hop"" clothes, a ""pimp coat,"" a prison jumpsuit, a pith helmet, and a ""sushi chef"" headband. The founders were anonymous, known only by their online screen names. That fall, Hollywood agent Guy Oseary reached out to Yuga Labs, eventually investing in the company and joining its board. Soon celebrities started posting their Bored Apes on social media — including Oseary's client Madonna, along with Steph Curry, Lil Baby, DJ Khaled, Snoop Dogg, Gwyneth Paltrow, and more. Bored Apes started selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Justin Bieber bought an ape for $1.3 million. By March 2022, Yuga got a $450 million venture capital investment, and was valued at $4 billion.The class action lawsuit claims, ""this purported interest in"" Bored Apes ""by high-profile taste makers was entirely manufactured by Oseary at the behest of"" Yuga Labs. ""In order to make the promotion of, and subsequent interest in, the BAYC NFTs appear to be organic (as opposed to being solely the result of a paid promotion), the Company needed a way to discreetly pay their celebrity cohorts."" The suit alleges they did this through MoonPay.When Jimmy Fallon introduced his audience to crypto, he also presented a frictionless way to buy in: MoonPay, a payments company that allows customers to buy crypto through most major payment systems like with a credit card. In November 2021, Fallon said on ""The Tonight Show"" that he'd bought his first NFT through MoonPay. ""MoonPay? MoonPay! I did my homework — Moonpay, which is like PayPal but for crypto,"" Fallon said. The following January, when Hilton showed her ape on the show, she said, ""You said you got it on MoonPay, so I went and I copied you."" A few months later, in April 2022, MoonPay announced more than 60 celebrities and influencers had invested in the firm. MoonPay spokesman Justin Hamilton told CNN that Hilton became an investor, but not until after she spoke with Fallon on ""The Tonight Show."" The FTC generally requires an endorser to disclose when they have a financial interest in promoting a company. The celebrity hype and unbelievable prices generated enormous media interest. ""Rolling Stone"" minted NFTs of the magazine with Bored Apes on the cover. Guy Oseary was on the cover of ""Variety"" under the headline ""NFT King.""Inside the world of MoonPayIndependent journalists, under the names of Coffeezilla and Dirty Bubble Media, noticed blockchain ledger records suggesting not everything was as it appeared. Cryptocurrency is traded on the blockchain, a permanent and public ledger of every transaction. That means it can reveal financial relationships, if you figure out the right questions to ask. Hours before Justin Bieber bought an ape for the equivalent of $1.3 million on January 29, 2022, Bieber received Ethereum worth about $2.5 million in his crypto wallet, the blockchain shows. A couple weeks before Post Malone released a music video in November 2021 in which he bought a Bored Ape through MoonPay, MoonPay transferred cryptocurrency then worth about $760,000 into the artist's wallet, and sent two more payments, worth about $640,000, a couple weeks after. MoonPay admits it paid for the placement in Post Malone's video but says other celebrities paid full price for their service in US dollars. Many celebrities who got apes thanked MoonPay on social media. Gwyneth Paltrow tweeted, ""Joined @BoredApeYC ready for the reveal? Thanks @moonpay concierge."" The rapper Gunna posted on Instagram, ""I Bought A @boredapeyachtclub NFT worth 300K No Cap ! His Name is BUTTA Thanks @moonpay !"" Lil Baby mentioned MoonPay in his song ""Top Priority."" The blockchain shows MoonPay paying high prices for the apes, and then transferring them to purported celebrity wallets for free. MoonPay explains this as a service that helps wealthy people buy NFTs without setting up their own crypto wallet. The company says the ""white-glove"" service was created because MoonPay's CEO, Ivan Soto-Wright, had a lot of celebrity friends, and many of them asked how they could get an NFT. Jimmy Fallon, Lil Baby — they were Soto-Wright's friends, Hamilton said. CNN spoke to several former MoonPay employees who said they were skeptical the celebrities paid for their NFTs, because there was no evidence on the blockchain.The company's ape purchases have been significant. Since 2021, one of its wallets, ""MoonPayHQ,"" has spent at least $25 million on NFTs — 60% or about $15 million of that was spent on Bored Apes. The company told CNN they had 14 apes in a cold storage wallet, which offers more safety. It said that five of those NFTs were ""purchased by concierge clients that are in the process of being transferred."" The last ape was purchased in April 2022, 10 months ago, according to blockchain records.One influencer has said he was approached about an ape. In a Twitter Spaces audio chat last year, celebrity jeweler Ben Baller said, ""Real talk: not once, not twice, three times, I've been offered a Bored Ape through MoonPay. ... The fact that some of these super top-tier all-star NBA players have them? And I was like, 'Yo this is all cap [lies.]' They didn't buy this sh*t.""  Baller did not respond to CNN's request for comment. MoonPay's spokesman said this didn't happen.Oseary, the Hollywood agent and MoonPay/Yuga investor, texted CNN in response to a question: ""NO ONE is paid to join the club and Yuga do NOT and have NOT given away any apes.""  He said he paid full price for his Bored Ape, and so did Madonna.Yuga Labs declined an on-the-record interview with CNN. In a statement, the company said, ""In our view, these claims are opportunistic and parasitic. We strongly believe that they are without merit, and look forward to proving as much."" Hamilton, MoonPay's spokesman, said of the lawsuit, ""We look forward to it being dismissed.""Anonymity and accusations""The fine art market is a scam -- that's OK, at least there's art going on,"" said Max Gail, who's been a blockchain developer since 2010, and founded Omakasea and Eth Gobblers.com. (Gail hosted the Twitter Space in which Baller discussed Bored Apes.) The NFT market, he said, ""is like a parody of the fine art market. They took the same strategies that had been employed in the fine art market, but then distorted it with some strange crypto economics.""Anonymous buyers and sellers dealing in items whose values are difficult to calculate has made the fine art market susceptible to money laundering, a Senate investigation found in 2020. In 2022, an average of more than half of NFT trading volume on the Ethereum blockchain was ""wash"" trading, according to an analysis at Dune Analytics. (Most NFTs are on Ethereum.) Essentially, wash trades are a transaction in which the buyer and seller are the same person, or they're working together. Wash trading has been illegal in traditional finance since the Great Depression, because it can distort the market by making people believe there is a high volume of interest in the investment. The ability to open many anonymous cryptocurrency wallets makes wash trading NFTs easier. A Chainalysis report found one ""prolific NFT wash trader"" made 830 sales to self-financed wallets in 2021.Though NFTs have been celebrated as the future of digital art, and a way for artists to earn royalties, many NFT collections operate more like securities — a financial instrument, like stocks or bonds, that hold some monetary value. ""People will say that the technology itself has provided this whole new way of creating digital art,"" Harvard's Molly White said. ""It's not that unique. The unique part of it is the speculative bubble.""The NFT marketplace does not always make sense even to those who benefit from it. ""Bored Apes have gone from $100 to $100,000 in a year. Nothing appreciates that fast,"" a successful NFT artist said. The artist's own works had gone from a couple hundred dollars to tens of thousands. One of the artist's major collectors ""treats me as a commodity and my art is a commodity and he's always pumping and dumping it. ... It's being treated as a financial vehicle."" But there is pressure not to raise questions about the system. The NFT artist did not want to go on the record, saying it would be career suicide. ""The big collectors watch for artists that FUD. And as soon as an artist FUDs, they get cancelled,"" the artist said. FUD is ""fear, uncertainty, and doubt,"" or criticism of crypto.Beyond how the Bored Ape NFTs are traded, what they depict is at issue in yet another Yuga Labs legal battle. In the fall of 2021, accusations began swirling on social media that the Bored Ape Yacht Club contained visual references to racist memes from the troll site, 4chan. The artist Ryder Ripps — who's worked with stars like Kanye West and Tame Impala — started tweeting about the claims of racist imagery. Ripps claims Guy Oseary, the Hollywood agent on Yuga's board, called to pressure him to stop talking about the claims. (Oseary told CNN, ""I can't speak on active litigation."") Ripps doubled down and made a website cataloging the claims. Then, in an act he says was meant to protest the alleged racism and comment on the idea you can't copy an NFT, Ripps made copycat NFTs he sold as RR/BAYC. Yuga sued Ripps for trademark infringement, and argues that his maligning of the Yuga apes is nothing more than a profiteering tactic. Ripps says Yuga is trying to silence its critics, and has doubled down on his claims as part of his defense in the trademark suit. Yuga Labs called the accusations ""the incoherent ramblings of a small group of for-profit conspiracy theorists."" However, the Yuga lawsuit against Ripps could affect the class action lawsuit against Yuga. Ripps's lawyers have issued subpoenas to Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon.To assert its trademark rights, Yuga must show that consumers associate its logos with its products, and it did so in a legal filing, in part, by pointing to celebrity owners ""including TV host Jimmy Fallon...""Ripps's lawyer, Louis Tompros, asserts Yuga compensated celebrities for promoting its NFTs, and they did not disclose it. ""And by doing that, in our view, they have gotten this public notoriety for their brand improperly,"" Tompros told CNN. ""And so having gotten it improperly, they now can't go and assert that they have these rights.""This week Yuga co-founder Wylie Aronow published a 24-page letter explaining that he was stepping back from the company and addressing widespread rumors that the company and its products were connected to the alt-right.""I will soon call out this utter bullsh*t under oath,"" he wrote.So what are the racist references alleged by Ripps and others? To start, there's what's right on the surface: some of the NFTs are pictures of apes in ""hip hop"" clothes, a ""pimp coat,"" a prison uniform, a bone necklace, gold and diamond grills. Record executive Dame Dash, a crypto enthusiast, pointed out on a podcast last year that monkeys and apes are old racist tropes. ""Think if you were a racist, like 'Guess what I'm gonna do? I'mma get Black people to love monkeys so much that they gonna buy them, wear them on their neck... go to something called ApeFest and they're gonna like it!' Wouldn't that sound funny?"" Dash said on the podcast. ""That's what's happening.""Dash told CNN he hadn't intended to target Yuga directly. But he'd started to wonder if he was being trolled, given the ubiquity of apes in crypto. ""Racism is different these days — you can't be so overt about it. You have to kind of troll,"" Dash said. This week Yuga agreed to settle a lawsuit with a developer who worked with Ripps, with the developer agreeing to pay them $25,000 and saying he would reject all disparaging statements against Yuga Labs.Ryan Hickman, a software engineer who also worked with Ripps on RR/BAYC, is also being sued separately by Yuga. Hickman, who is Black, thought the Bored Apes looked like stereotypical portrayals of Black people as stupid or lazy. He said he thought this would be obvious to most people the second they saw an image of a Bored Ape. But, he said, ""then somebody says, 'Well, it's worth $100,000.' They say, 'Okay well, tell me more.'"" In a statement, Yuga said, ""Our company and founders strongly condemn the spread of hate, in any form, against any group."" Hollywood agent Oseary said he'd never been on the troll site 4chan.The crypto community has adopted a lot of terms — rekt, frens, wagmi —  that were popularized on 4chan, and it's not always clear if the person using them understands where they came from. ""I doubt that they were a massive alt-right troll campaign,"" Harvard's Molly White said. ""I do think it's likely that the creators of the project basically included some nods to 4chan.""""It's not one thing that makes it racist. It's everything together as a package,"" programmer and 8chan founder Fredrick Brennan said, looking at comparisons between Pepe the Frog memes and Bored Apes. Brennan took an interest in the claims that Yuga referenced 4chan memes, because he'd seen them so often when he was running 8chan, a similar troll site. He quit 8chan in 2016, and in 2019 pushed for it to be taken down because it had become a hub for extremist violence. He began to suspect the Yuga founders were like the people he used to know. Take one of the apes' characteristics, which Yuga calls a ""sushi chef headband."" Brennan reads and speaks Japanese, and saw the headband actually said ""kamikaze,"" which has been used as a slur against Japanese people. A similar headband appeared on a Pepe meme. ""That one was the most shocking,"" he told CNN. In a legal filing connected to the Ripps case, Yuga said the apes reflected a combination of many traits, ""not any person's purported racism.""""I was hoping, in my eternal optimism,"" Brennan said, ""that people would become a lot more skeptical of tech bros. ... And that liberal — so-called — celebrities in Hollywood would view these people with suspicion. Apparently not.""-- CORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify when Paris Hilton invested in MoonPay. Jimmy Fallon is not an investor, a company spokesman said."

12,'Your Place or Mine' pairs Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon in a split-screen rom-com,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/entertainment/your-place-or-mine-review/index.html,"Kutcher and Witherspoon received some playful mockery for the awkwardness of their red-carpet photos together, but when you actually see the film it makes more sense, since the two share relatively few scenes. Then again, the movie is as much about real estate as romance, as well as the familiar question of paths taken and not chosen.Despite a fleeting history described as a ""hookup,"" Kutcher's Peter and Witherspoon's Debbie have been platonic friends for 20 years. They still talk regularly, with him leading the life of a wealthy playboy business consultant in New York (Batman without the cool toys), and her located in Los Angeles, grappling with the challenges of single motherhood to a 13-year-old son (Wesley Kimmel, Jimmy's nephew), whose allergies make her a trifle overprotective.Scheduled to spend a week in New York getting a degree that will advance her career, Debbie abruptly loses her babysitting, at which point Peter gallantly steps in, offering to fly to LA and stay at her house and look after her kid while she occupies his luxury apartment.In the process, they both get to walk a few miles in the other's shoes (and lives), like one of those reality-TV shows, only with a better musical score and nicer accessories.Written and directed by Aline Brosh McKenna of ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" renown (who also produced along with, among others, Witherspoon and Jason Bateman), ""Your Place"" hinges on Peter and Debbie learning to appreciate each other's differences -- she's a stickler for routine, while he's free-spirited, or ""irresponsible"" in her eyes -- through their house-swap experiences.That's weak fuel to keep the wheels churning even on this sort of vehicle, so various subplots emerge, like Peter trying to loosen up restrictions on Debbie's kid, and Debbie discovering an unpublished book Peter has written, which comes into play when his eager-to-be-chummy ex-girlfriend (Zoë Chao) introduces her to a dashing (and also divorced) publisher, played by Jesse Williams.Brosh McKenna clearly knows her way around the genre (her writing credits also include ""27 Dresses""), as do her stars. The supporting players -- including Steve Zahn as a hippie-dippy LA neighbor -- are quirky enough to shoulder some of the load.Even grading on a rom-com curve, though, the structure makes the movie a bit of a slog as it oscillates between Debbie and Peter's arcs, after the latter has rather feebly explained that the two aren't together by saying, ""Because she's her, and I'm me.""""Your Place or Mine"" will probably do just fine for Netflix, standing out from a pack of Valentine's Day-timed rom-coms because Witherspoon is her, and Kutcher is him. But those awkward red-carpet photos weren't the only part of this exercise that didn't quite work, whatever place one happens to watch it.""Your Place or Mine"" premieres February 10 on Netflix. It's rated PG-13."

News of his release came as France announced that the French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah had also been released from Evin.Meysami was jailed in 2018 after voicing his support for women protesting the compulsory hijab law. He was charged with ""assembly and collusion to act against national security"" and of ""propaganda against the regime."" according to a group focused on Iran, Human Rights Activists (HRANA).Images showing his frail body, protruding bones and shaved head caused outrage on social media when they surfaced last week. Prior to the emergence of the photos a human rights lawyer claiming to represent Meysami said his weight had decreased to 52 kilos (115 lb) and that he had been ""beaten due to his resistance"" to being transferred to a different prison.The text of a letter allegedly written by Meysami and provided to CNN by the lawyer, Mohammad Moghimi, showed that Meysami had gone on hunger strike to protest the execution of prisoners, to call for the release of several protesters and to demand the end of enforcement of the compulsory hijab law. CNN could not verify the authenticity of the letter.After the images of Meysami circulated online, state affiliated media last Friday denied the activist was on hunger strike, and said that he was in ""good condition."" News of Meysami and Adelkhah's release comes after Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei issued an amnesty covering a large number of prisoners on Sunday. The amnesty included some people who had been arrested in recent anti-government protests that have swept the country since last fall, according to HRANA.Nationwide dissent erupted late last year, as decades of bitterness over the regime's treatment of women and other issues boiled over after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the country's morality police.Authorities have violently repressed the months-long movement, which has posed one of the biggest domestic threats to Iran's ruling clerical regime in more than a decade.CNN has reached out to Iran's government for comment on Meysami's release.French-Iranian academic releasedFor decades, Evin prison in the Iranian capital of Tehran has housed political prisoners and dual nationals whom Iran refuses to officially recognize. Meysami's release came as the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that French-Iranian academic, Fariba Adelkhah, had also been also released from Evin.The ministry said in a statement Friday that ""France rejoices at the release this evening of Madame Fariba Adelkhah, researcher at the International Research Centre at Sciences Po who was unjustly detained in Iran in Evin prison.""It added it was ""essential"" that Adelkhah be able to recover all of her freedoms ""including (being allowed) to return to France if she wishes.""Adelkhah was arrested in Iran on June 5, 2019, according to the Sciences Po official website, alongside her colleague and fellow researcher, Roland Marchal. Adelkhah was accused of ""propaganda against the Islamic Republic's political system"" and ""collusion to undermine national security."" While Marchal was released on March 20, 2020, Adelkhah was served a five-year prison sentence on May 16, 2020.French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna called Adelkhah's release a ""great joy"" in a tweet Friday evening. The director of French university, Sciences Po, Mathias Vicherat also responded in a tweet: ""What joy, what relief to learn of the confirmation of the release of our friend, our colleague, Fariba Adelkhah."" France reiterated its demand for the ""immediate release"" of all French people arbitrarily detained in Iran, with the foreign minister demanding her Iranian counterpart immediately release seven French ""hostages."" A ministry spokesman said it is ""extremely concerned"" about the health of French national Benjamin Brière and French-Irish national Bernard Phelan in particular.""It is evident that this politics of state hostages carried out by the Islamic Republic of Iran is reprehensible and cannot but contribute to a profound degradation in our bilateral relations like the relations of Iran with Europe,"" the spokesperson said Thursday."

But since reopening after COVID, staffing levels were so short, workers were performing six days a week. ""They love to tell us that we're not Broadway and it's absolutely correct,"" Zapcic said.

19,Opinion: Mitt Romney's moments of truth,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/opinions/mitt-romney-speaks-out-opinion-column-galant/index.html,"But his remark about Russia being America's ""number one geopolitical foe"" — which was widely ridiculed at the time — now seems prescient in the wake of Vladimir Putin's murderous invasion of Ukraine. In the past few years, the senator from Utah has earned a reputation for being a rare, candid voice in Washington, willing to buck his party. He was the lone Republican who voted to remove President Donald Trump from office in his first impeachment trial and one of seven to do so in Trump's second impeachment. Minutes before the State of the Union speech Tuesday, Romney encountered the scandal-ridden Republican Rep. George Santos on the House floor and told him what many of the New York congressman's constituents — and others around the country — are saying: ""You don't belong here."" (Santos told reporters afterward: ""It wasn't very Mormon of him."")Even more tellingly, Romney broke with his party's stance on China's spy balloon. After a closed-door briefing by administration officials Thursday, Romney told reporters, ""I believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care,"" and said he agreed with their decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until it moved over the Atlantic Ocean, off the Carolinas. House Republicans, who were initially planning a resolution condemning the Biden administration for not bringing down the balloon sooner, switched the wording to condemn the government of China for sending the craft over US territory in the first place. It passed 419-0, a small act of bipartisanship only two days after a group of House Republicans heckled President Joe Biden as he was addressing both houses in his annual speech. There are not a lot of Romneys — or indeed any — in the ranks of the extreme GOPers who bucked their own House Speaker's shushing to shout their displeasure at Biden's remarks.""Some members of the Republican caucus seemed keen to highlight the distinctions between the thoughtful, unity-emphasizing Biden and their own party's shameful descent,"" wrote Jill Filipovic. ""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, among others, repeatedly booed and yelled throughout the speech; when he introduced the parents of Tyre Nichols, who was last month fatally beaten by Memphis police officers, and the Ukrainian ambassador, she stayed seated. That perhaps says more than Biden ever could.""ShushingSE Cupp called McCarthy's ""shushing"" a ""surprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the House Oversight Committee with election deniers."" ""Will he continue to 'shush' the extremist, conspiratorial and 'Never Biden' wing of his party — whom he has empowered and elevated — as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with Biden from time to time?""Geoff Duncan, a Republican who formerly served as Georgia's lieutenant governor, wrote that ""neither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the president — despite both issues being of importance to voters. Neither did the Chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines Biden's tough talk toward Chinese President Xi Jinping."" Biden ""was feisty, full of energy, marshaled his arguments effectively and even batted back Republican catcalls with good humor,"" observed David Gergen. ""By the end of the evening, he looked like a boxer who can't wait to get into the ring again.""""But he now faces an even sterner test: Did he actually move the needle? Among presidents of the recent past, a public appearance as powerful as this one could shake up politics. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan each had the capacity to change minds when they held a microphone."" The president's ""discussion of 'the talk' that Black parents give to their children about how to safely interact with police officers was the most moving part of his speech,"" wrote former Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Democrat. ""Still, it was political malpractice for him not to explicitly call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The family of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was fatally beaten by Memphis police officers last month, deserved to hear it."" PopulismRaul Reyes noted that ""Biden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use American-made materials.""  The 80-year-old president's vision was decidedly blue-collar — and 20th century — in its aim to rebuild America's manufacturing base and reduce the reliance on trade with the rest of the world. But, as Julian Zelizer pointed out, ""times have changed and Biden has a tough road ahead. While the president offered a robust vision of how federal investment has and could create jobs in key sectors such as the semi-conductor industry and infrastructure, the kinds of manufacturing jobs that were at the heart of federal investment between the 1930s and 1960s have vastly diminished and are not likely to return."" ""Biden needs to acknowledge how his economic populism will address the industries of the 2020s rather than those of the 1950s and 1960s."" Biden's success in 2020 owed a lot to the contrast with the chaos and extremism of the Trump administration, Bill McGowan and Juliana Silva wrote. The outbursts by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her colleagues allow Biden to surf the same wave now. ""By keeping the hostility factor high, the GOP is also paving the way for Biden to reuse in 2024 one of his stickiest and most effective campaign messages from 2020: that the election is nothing short of a battle for the 'soul of the nation.' Thanks to the new breed of attention-seeking, far-right Republicans, Biden gets to go back to that well regardless of whether Trump is his opponent or not."" The president turned the heckling to his advantage by getting Republicans to deny any intention of cutting Social Security or Medicare. ""You can say Mr. Biden fibbed, misled and exaggerated, and you wouldn't be wrong,"" Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ""but in rope-a-doping Republicans on Medicare and Social Security he showed real mastery."" New generation?In ""a scathing rebuke"" to Biden's speech that served as the GOP's official reply, ""Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it's time for a new generation of Republican leadership,"" Alice Stewart noted.""At 40, Sanders is the youngest governor in the country. She spoke of Biden as the oldest president in American history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply 'unfit to serve as commander in chief.'""Left unsaid was that Trump, Sanders' former boss, would be 78 by Election Day, 2024 — and he is running for the presidency again.Patrick T. Brown spoke for a lot of Americans when he pleaded for something other than a Biden-Trump rematch: ""A 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice.""""New polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters told a Washington Post/ABC News poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than Biden in 2024. According to the poll, 49% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former President Donald Trump.""

A devastating earthquake had struck and they hurried out of the building in their pajamas into snow-filled streets. Taking refuge in their car, away from any buildings, Alomar spoke to CNN Opinion's Sheena McKenzie about the toll the quake is taking on a region already devastated by war. Alomar is a pediatrician who works as a senior health adviser with the Syrian American Medical Society, providing medical assistance across the border. ""In northwest Syria, we are already suffering from a shortage of supplies, and we are now using the regular inventories in our warehouses,"" Alomar said.""So we are in urgent need of additional support to compensate these supplies for regular operations — and also to be ready for aftershocks and more casualties who may come to our hospitals."" In the New York Times, Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk wrote, ""Aid has been dispatched, but the trucks loaded with supplies are stuck for hours on jammed roads hundreds of miles from the affected areas. People who have lost their homes, their families, their loved ones, everything they ever had find that there is nobody doing anything about the fires beginning to break out in their cities. And so they block the path of any official vehicle, policeman or government employee they can find and start to remonstrate. I have never seen our people so angry.""As of Sunday, the death toll in the quake stood at more than 28,000, with tens of thousands injured.Zelensky, a year laterA year ago, shortly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, former comedian-turned-president ""Volodymyr Zelensky's popularity ratings were tanking as he battled allegations of unmet campaign promises to tackle endemic corruption,"" recalled Michael Bociurkiw. ""Then on February 24, Russia's total invasion blasted these concerns into the background. Almost overnight, that dark cloud over Zelensky vanished as he defied critics, and miraculously pivoted into the role of heroic wartime president and global symbol of defender of the free world.""""His popularity ratings surged — and have stayed high ever since — currently hovering at around 84%.""But corruption is still pervasive in Ukraine, as recent allegations and a new crackdown have shown, and Bociurkiw argued that it's vital to keep fighting it.""Zelensky needs to respond to allegations of wrongdoing with the same determination that Ukrainian servicemen have demonstrated on the battlefield.""""This is an opportunity to create a nation where corruption is not tolerated, and where oligarchs no longer have a free hand to rape and pillage the economy.""For more: Anshel Pfeffer: Why Netanyahu is suddenly a lot less friendly with PutinChina balloonWhat would China have done if a US balloon entered its airspace, intelligence analyst Beth Sanner asked. China would have shot it down ""without hesitation, regardless of any risk to Chinese citizens or property.""""So China's protestations about the outrageousness of the US shootdown of a spy balloon flying over our sovereign territory seem a little rich, to put it mildly,"" Sanner wrote.  ""I understand why Americans were alarmed by the balloon,"" she added, ""but there are much bigger threats posed by China. We should address the shortcomings this incident exposed — including what appears to be gaps in our air defense and detection systems that would have allowed us to shoot such a balloon down before it ever reached US landfall — but political one-upmanship on such a fraught and grave matter as relations with China is dangerous."" Napoleon's soldiers used balloons for surveillance in 1794, as did Union soldiers during the US Civil War. Peter Bergen's father worked on a US Air Force program that sent balloons over the Soviet Union in the 1950s, Bergen wrote. But there's newer technology in the form of satellites that can take video, use thermal imagery to detect people moving around at night and ""spy on pretty much anything, with a resolution of centimeters,"" Bergen noted. ""In other words, the overflight of US territory by China's balloon is not a national security catastrophe as a bunch of hyperventilating Republican politicians from former President Donald Trump on downward have implied,"" Bergen added.

But CNN Opinion's Kirsi Goldynia wrote, ""As endearing as it is to imagine a politician scarfing down a frank with all the fixings or a bowl of chocolate ice cream, new research is exposing the health impacts of diets like Pelosi's, high in ultraprocessed foods.""""Pelosi isn't an outlier.

Goldynia interviewed Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert and retired professor at New York University. ""Studies show that ultraprocessed foods encourage people to eat more calories,"" Nestle said, ""and the subjects gain weight as a result. So, if you want to do something about obesity, and you want to lose weight, one way to do that would be to eat fewer ultraprocessed foods...

20,A gibbon who lived alone in her cage had a baby. Japanese zookeepers finally know how,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/asia/japan-zoo-gibbon-pregnancy-mystery-intl-hnk/index.html,"Momo, a 12-year-old white-handed gibbon, shocked her keepers at the Kujukushima Zoo and Botanical Garden in Nagasaki in February 2021 when she gave birth despite having no known male companionship.Now two years later, following a DNA test on her baby, the zoo has worked out who the father is -- and even has a theory about how the gibbons mated.The test showed the father to be Itō, a 34-year-old agile gibbon, who was in an adjacent enclosure to Momo around the time she became pregnant.The zoo told CNN on Friday it believed that Momo and Itō had managed to mate through a small hole in a steel plate between their enclosures. The hole measured about 9 millimeters (0.3 inch) in diameter.The baby ape -- who is yet to be named -- now weighs around 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) and is ""growing healthily"" under Momo's loving attention, the zoo said. ""It is a precious life born into the world, we will continue to take good care of him and hope that he will live a healthy long life,"" said Hideki Hisano, deputy director of the zoo.Gibbons are among the smallest apes, but they have loud singing voices that have developed into an elaborate language, and  can swing from branch to branch at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. There are dozens of gibbon species that are native to parts of Asia, ranging from northeastern India to China and all the way to the Borneo archipelago.The population of agile gibbons in the wild has been decreasing and they have been listed as an endangered species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature, because their habitat is threatened by human activities such as deforestation, mining and road construction."

""She said she knew the amount of money they were asking. ""She felt that Alex was not being truthful to her with regard to what was going on with that lawsuit. She said he doesn't tell me everything.""Turrubiate-Simpson, who said she was a friend of the Murdaugh family, also testified Alex Murdaugh asked her the day after Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, the couple's grown son, were killed at a family property to clean the home there.""He said there was going to be people probably stopping by and bringing food and stuff,"" Turrubiate-Simpson said. ""He said I just want the house to look the way Maggie would like for it to look. So, I said OK and I went to the house.""Alex Murdaugh is on trial for the killings on June 7, 2021. He has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and two weapons charges, with the trial expected to last about two more weeks.Much of this week's testimony has focused on Alex Murdaugh's financial issues. The judge ruled Monday to allow such evidence, saying it was ""so intimately connected"" with the state's case ""that proof of it is essential to complete the story."" Ahead of Turrubiate-Simpson's testimony, some Murdaugh relatives were ordered this week to sit farther back in the South Carolina courtroom due to inappropriate contact and conduct, the Colleton County clerk of court said.In court Wednesday, Alex Murdaugh's sister Lynn Murdaugh Goettee passed him a book through a member of his defense team. It was not shared with the victim's advocate, and Goettee had been admonished just five minutes before that, a source with knowledge of the incident told CNN.The book was considered contraband because it was not clear what was in it, the source said, adding Murdaugh was already back in his jail cell with it before anybody could check it. The book -- John Grisham's ""The Judge's List"" -- was later confiscated. State Judge Clifton Newman also was made aware of an obscene gesture Alex Murdaugh's surviving son Buster Murdaugh made toward Mark Tinsley, the attorney representing the family of Mallory Beach, who was killed in a 2019 boat crash involving Paul Murdaugh, Colleton County Clerk of Court Rebecca Hill told CNN. The gesture happened Monday during Tinsley's testimony outside the presence of the jury.The younger Murdaugh was admonished for the incident, Hill said. Lynn Murdaugh Goettee and Buster Murdaugh have been warned that any more violations will result in them being barred from the courtroom.Amid the book incident, Wednesday's testimony was interrupted when a bomb threat was called into the clerk's office and the courthouse in Walterboro was evacuated, Hill said. Court resumed hours later.Tinsley's testimony continued Friday after ending Thursday with him on the stand. He represents the family of the 19-year-old Beach, who was killed when a boat owned by Alex Murdaugh and allegedly driven by Paul Murdaugh crashed.More witnesses identify Murdaugh's voice in videoTurrubiate-Simpson and Nathan Tuten, Paul's childhood friend, also both identified in court Friday Alex Murdaugh's voice in a key video authorities say was recorded shortly before the killings.The video, just short of a minute long, was filmed on Paul Murdaugh's phone starting at 8:44 p.m. the night of the killings, a law enforcement witness testified earlier in the trial. Three different voices can be heard in the footage, which appeared to have been recorded around the Murdaugh family's kennels, according to that earlier testimony. Turrubiate-Simpson and Tuten both identified Paul, Maggie and Alex Murdaugh's voices in the clip. At least three other witnesses in the trial have identified Alex Murdaugh's voice as the third one in the video, though he has repeatedly denied being at the kennels around the time of the killings. Prosecutor hopes to wrap up case next weekLegal teams on Thursday offered a glimpse into the remaining trial schedule: Closing arguments could start around February 23, based on attorneys' estimates -- weeks after Friday's originally scheduled end date.The state hoped to rest its case by the middle of next week, prosecutor Creighton Waters said, while the defense will need at least a week, defense attorney Dick Harpootlian said, noting it could be on the shorter side because of how long testimony already has lasted. The defense has out-of-state expert witnesses who will require travel and lodging, Harpootlian said, pointing out the length of the state's case is making that difficult and expensive to schedule. The state so far has called 44 witnesses and introduced more than 400 exhibits of evidence. Harpootlian planned to ask the judge to let jurors visit Moselle, the hunting property where Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were killed, he said in opening statements.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported whose testimony was underway when Buster Murdaugh allegedly made an obscene gesture; it was Mark Tinsley's. It also misstated which John Grisham book was confiscated from Alex Murdaugh; it was ""The Judge's List."""
22,"Consumer sentiment rises to 13-month high on strong jobs report, lower inflation",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/economy/consumer-sentiment-february-preliminary/index.html,"The preliminary consumer sentiment index for February increased to 66.4 from 64.9 in January, the university reported Friday. That's the best reading since January 2021, when the index read 67.2.Economists were expecting the headline index to increase slightly to 65, according to consensus estimates on Refinitiv.Sentiment has been buoyed by the recent cooldown in inflation and continued strong economic data — especially the job market, said Joanna Hsu, director of the university's Surveys of Consumers, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday. In January, the US economy added 517,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, the lowest level since May 1969.""As long as consumers still believe that their incomes are going to remain strong, I think that will continue to lift consumer sentiment and their willingness to spend,"" Hsu said. However, the uncertain economic picture has many consumers still concerned about what's coming. While the index measuring consumer sentiment about current economic conditions increased to the highest level since December 2021, the index of consumer expectations, which measures sentiment about where the economy will be in a year's time and also five years' time, dipped to 62.3 from 62.7.""Consumers are very much bracing for a downturn, bracing for more unemployment, and so they are going to be continuing to be cautious with their spending,"" she noted.More than 40% of survey respondents said they believe unemployment will worsen in the year ahead, Hsu said. That share is up from 25% measured last year. Another potential wild card could be the debt ceiling, she said. Three weeks ago, the US reached its $31.4 trillion debt limit set by Congress, and the Treasury has started taking ""extraordinary measures"" to avoid default as pressure grows for Congress to act.Consumer sentiment took a hit during previous debt ceiling run-ups in 2011 and 2013, she said. ""It's not really on the forefront of consumers' minds right now, but as negotiations escalate, I do expect that to weigh on consumers' anxiety over the economy,"" she told Bloomberg.  The survey also showed that consumers are expecting inflation to remain high in the near term. One-year inflation expectations increased to 4.2% from 3.9% in January. Gas prices rising in recent weeks likely contributed to that rebound, Hsu said. Long-run inflation expectations held steady at 2.9% for the third consecutive month.Inflation expectations are crucial data points for the Federal Reserve. If consumers believe prices will remain high, that could factor in to increased wage demands, which could cause businesses to raise prices.Sentiment, as measured by the university's consumer surveys, has been on an upswing for three months. However, it's still 22% below the historical average since 1978, according to the university. "

In the tiebreak, with Bublik coughing up three double faults and falling 6-0 behind, his composure failed him and he smashed his racquet on the court five times. He then walked to his bag to get another racquet, which he also proceeded to whack on the floor. Not quite done, he grabbed another racquet and repeatedly banged that one on the court. Unsurprisingly, he was warned for racquet abuse.

26,Opinion: Honor Tyre Nichols by reimagining public safety,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/opinions/tyre-nichols-public-safety-us-nichols-watkins/index.html,"In the days leading up to the release of the video footage showing Tyre's last moments, Memphis felt unnaturally quiet. A tense, uneasy quiet that wrapped around us like a fog. Yes, our community had seen the effects of police violence all over the country, and here at home as well -- Darrius Stewart was shot and killed in 2015, Martavious Banks survived being shot in 2018 -- and the list goes on. But this time was different. It felt heavier, ominous...and the eyes of the nation were on us. In reality, it was not quiet in our city that week — nor has it been quiet any week since. Our collective anger and grief have overflowed to the streets of Memphis. We have shouted out for accountability through protest. We have talked face-to-face with Shelby District Attorney Steve Mulroy. We have spoken before the Memphis City Council. We have put pressure on the Memphis Police Department (MPD) for more transparency. We have cried out with and for Tyre's family at prayer vigils. We were not silent; we were enraged. Though we had not yet seen the video, we had seen the image of a swollen, battered young man in his hospital bed. We heard from his family's lawyers the horrific descriptions of what had happened to him at the hands of law enforcement. We understood that his mother could barely watch the first minute of it. So, without seeing, we knew. Still, it seemed the city had entered a tense pause. Waiting to see: Would this time be different? Would this case of death-by-policing lead to any substantive accountability or any lasting change in law enforcement? Do we dare to hope there might actually be #JusticeForTyre, when there had not been true justice for so many before him?  As we waited, the names and faces of five Black officers came across our screens. Betrayal was added to the anger and grief we were already feeling. Betrayal, but not surprise. As Black and brown people, we have plenty of experience with our people becoming instruments of White supremacist culture. When the videos were released, they confirmed what we already knew: that it was time, again, to fight for our lives. That's what we've continued to do in the days since.We've been down this road before — as a city, as a country, as Black and brown people. We keep hoping it doesn't happen again — and then it does. Tyre was clearly just trying to survive a traffic stop and get home to his parents — to his mother. And he knew, just as well as the rest of us with Black and brown skin, that getting home was not guaranteed. The ongoing revelation of more MPD officers, sheriff's deputies and EMT/fire department personnel being involved -- or not involved enough -- has further solidified our knowledge that it's not only the institution of policing that is to blame. Law enforcement, first response and public service writ large has an institutionally ingrained disregard for Black bodies and Black lives. As people of faith and shared values in Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope (MICAH), we join many others in our community in standing up for the dignity and humanity of Black and brown lives. We stand strong with the family of Tyre and those who loved him. Not one more person should go through this abuse and injustice -- especially at the hands of those who say their mission is to protect and to serve. It was clear at President Joe Biden's speech at the State of the Union that aspirations remain high --  he spoke ambitiously about ""finishing the job"" on police reform --  but actual solutions have, for so many years, remained elusive or been outright rejected, both at the federal level and here in Memphis. What would it mean for us to actually reimagine public safety? The story of our work begins with that question and has guided it since. The coalition that became MICAH took shape in the months after the police killing of Darrius Stewart. A few years later, we formed a working group calling for greater transparency from the MPD. Today, MICAH continues to work alongside powerful activist organizations such as Decarcerate Memphis and Official Black Lives Matter Memphis for data transparency and with the Justice and Safety Alliance to turn public attention and voter engagement toward a new vision of public safety.If we in the community don't know what standards and practices police are supposed to be holding themselves to, how can we be expected to accept the notion that only a ""few bad apples"" are the culprit? We need to see what rot is embedded in the tree itself. As of 2020, MPD policies and procedures are posted online. The 2019 training synopsis MPD shared with us reveals at least some of the rot in the tree. In new officers' 880 hours of training, 208 of those hours are spent on firearms training alone. Another 123 hours are spent on patrol procedures, including 36 hours on officer survival. By contrast, just 26 hours are spent on interpersonal communication, including just 10 hours on conflict resolution and de-escalation. If a budget is a moral document, then a training manual is a culture-creating document. And we can plainly see where MPD has placed its priorities.MPD has also reportedly dramatically lowered its recruitment standards for new officers -- including requiring previous police or military experience. A former lieutenant told the Associated Press, ""They would allow pretty much anybody to be a police officer."" MPD did not respond to requests for comment about hiring standards, but multiple news outlets quoted police Cerelyn ""CJ"" Davis, who took over in June 2021, as saying supervision of less experienced officers is crucial. She said, ""Culture eats policy for lunch in police departments.""We have also long called for Memphis' Civilian Law Enforcement Review Board (CLERB) to have subpoena power. The one body that should have true community oversight in cases of police conduct has been so systematically disempowered, it is left to make recommendations that MPD is essentially free to ignore. An ordinance was recently proposed that would require reporting on what happens to CLERB recommendations received by MPD -- as a step toward greater accountability from MPD and authority for CLERB.Here in Memphis, we're not going to stop pushing, along with our community partners, for data transparency, for better training, for more accountability. As we continue to grieve, we are also in building mode, looking to continue sharing demands from the families of those victimized by police violence even as we sharpen our own calls to MPD and local government here for the resources to promote cultural transformation around policing and truly reimagine public safety.Right now, we have the opportunity to fight for an ending that is not like the rest. And we will not give up."

29,What to know about the lawsuit aiming to ban medication abortion drug mifepristone,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/fda-medication-abortion-lawsuit-mifepristone/index.html,"The lawsuit, filed in November by anti-abortion advocates against the US Food and Drug Administration, targets the agency's 20-year-old approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion processMedication abortion, which now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the US, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the fallout from the Supreme Court's decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade.US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, has extended the briefing deadline in the case until February 24.Reproductive rights advocates say that if Kacsmaryk sides with the plaintiffs, ""it would eliminate the most commonly used method of abortion care,"" according to NARAL Pro-Choice America. Here's what to know about the lawsuit:What the lawsuit is seekingThe lawsuit, filed last year by a coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations under the umbrella of the ""Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine"" and several doctors, is seeking a number of actions by the court, chief among them a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering the FDA ""to withdraw mifepristone and misoprostol as FDA-approved chemical abortion drugs and to withdraw defendants' actions to deregulate these chemical abortion drugs."" ""After two decades of engaging the FDA to no avail, plaintiffs now ask this court to do what the FDA was and is legally required to do: protect women and girls by holding unlawful, setting aside, and vacating the FDA's actions to approve chemical abortion drugs and eviscerate crucial safeguards for those who undergo this dangerous drug regimen,"" the complaint reads. What FDA says The FDA responded to the lawsuit last month by asking the judge to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that issuing one in the matter ""would upend the status quo and the reliance interests of patients and doctors who depend on mifepristone, as well as businesses involved with mifepristone distribution."" The agency also says a ruling against it would set a dangerous precedent.""More generally, if longstanding FDA drug approvals were so easily enjoined, even decades after being issued, pharmaceutical companies would be unable to confidently rely on FDA approval decisions to develop the pharmaceutical-drug infrastructure that Americans depend on to treat a variety of health conditions,"" the FDA wrote.""A preliminary injunction would interfere with Congress's decision to entrust FDA with responsibility to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs. In discharging this role, FDA applies its technical expertise to make complex scientific determinations about drugs' safety and efficacy, and these determinations are entitled to substantial deference.""What the drug company saysDanco, which makes mifepristone, also made a similar request to the FDA's in a court filing, stressing that the lawsuit could decimate the company's business. ""Danco is a small pharmaceutical company. It sells one drug: Mifeprex,"" lawyers for the company wrote in court papers. ""Entering the mandatory preliminary injunction plaintiffs seek would force FDA to withdraw approval for Danco's only product, effectively shuttering Danco's business."" ""Congress entrusts decision-making like this with the FDA. And they're coming in trying to overrule that, saying this medication is unsafe because women bleed. Well, that's part of having an abortion. It's also part of having a pregnancy,"" said Ryan Brown, an attorney representing Danco in the case. ""The bottom line being that they just want to do away with abortion across the board and for any reason.""Who is the judge in the caseKacsmaryk was appointed to the court in 2017 by then-President Trump and was confirmed by a 52-46 vote in 2019.Since then, he's helped make Texas a legal graveyard for policies of President Joe Biden's administration, presiding over 95% of the civil cases brought in Amarillo, Texas.In December, Kacsmaryk put on hold the Biden administration's most recent attempt to end the so-called ""Remain in Mexico"" program. And he has overseen Texas cases challenging vaccine mandates, the gender identity guidance issued by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the administration's limits on the use of Covid-19 relief funds for tax cuts.Before joining the court, Kacsmaryk served as deputy general counsel at the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit religious liberty legal group, where he worked mainly on ""religious liberty litigation in federal courts and amicus briefs in the US Supreme Court,"" according to his White House biography.Red and blue states weigh in The case is being closely watched by a number of interested parties, including Republican and Democratic state attorneys general. On Friday, two different multi-state coalitions filed amicus briefs with the court urging them to act one way or another in the matter. A coalition of 22 Democratic attorneys general urged Kacsmaryk to deny the motion for a preliminary injunction, writing in court papers that ""annulling -- or even merely limiting -- any of the FDA's actions relating to medication abortion would result in an even more drastic reduction in abortion access across the entire nation, worsening already dire outcomes, deepening entrenched disparities in access to health care, and placing a potentially unbearable strain on the health care system as a whole."" And a coalition of 22 Republican attorneys general asked the court to issue the preliminary injunction, arguing the FDA exceeded its authority when it approved the medication. ""State laws on chemical abortion thus account for the public interests at issue -- and they do so with the benefit of democratic legitimacy (and legal authority). The FDA's actions can make no such claim. By obstructing the judgments of elected representatives, the agency has undermined the public interest,"" they wrote. What abortion-rights advocates are saying Abortion rights advocates have sounded the alarm on the case, stressing that a ruling by Kacsmaryk in favor of the plaintiffs would affect every corner of the country since the lawsuit is targeting a federal agency. ""If FDA approval of mifepristone is revoked, 64.5 million women of reproductive age in the US would lose access to medication abortion care, an exponential increase in harm overnight,"" NARAL said in a statement on Friday, pointing to internal research. ""This research reveals the high stakes of this lawsuit, and we can only expect the worst from this Trump-appointed federal judge. Americans want access to abortion, but anti-choice bad actors are dead set on restricting reproductive freedom by any means possible,"" said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, the group's vice president of communications and research. And activists are mobilizing in Texas around the issue, with the Women's March planning to hold a rally at the federal courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, on Saturday. ""We've said it before: the fight for reproductive rights now lies in the states, and legal challenges like these are just the latest example of how our fight is bigger than Roe,"" said Rachel Carmona, the executive director of Women's March. When will Kacsmaryk rule? On Thursday, Kacsmaryk told the plaintiffs that they had until February 24 to respond to a recent filing by the Danco, writing in an order that following the deadline, ""briefing will then be closed on the matter, absent any 'exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.'""On Friday, the plaintiffs in the case submitted one response to the FDA's filing. But the deadline extension means that after the plaintiffs submit a separate response to Danco, the case is ripe for judgment since all required briefings will have been filed.Kacsmaryk can rule at any time after that, though he could also call for a hearing, or ask for additional responses as well."

32,A subsidy arms race is kicking off between Europe and America,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/green-subsides-inflation-reduction-act-europe/index.html,"""Our Department of Energy estimates that the new law will reduce emissions in the United States by about 1 billion tons in 2030, while unleashing a new era of clean-energy-powered economic growth,"" Biden told world leaders at the UN's COP27 climate summit in November.But in directing roughly $370 billion in federal funding toward the rapid buildout of clean energy infrastructure, the United States has also kickstarted a global subsidies race, as world leaders claim the package unfairly favors American companies and say they have no choice but to respond with hefty incentives of their own. Last week, the European Commission unveiled its Green Deal Industrial Plan, which will marshal more than $270 billion in existing funds toward cutting red tape and delivering tax breaks for net-zero investments. The package was discussed at a meeting of EU leaders this week. Europe would push ahead with work ""to allow for targeted, temporary and proportionate support to be deployed speedily, including via tax credits, in those sectors that are strategic for the green transition and are adversely impacted by foreign subsidies or high energy prices,"" the EU leaders said in a statement on Friday.Hundreds of billions of dollars in government funding could help countries meet emissions goals that otherwise look increasingly elusive. Yet the emergence of a tit-for-tat approach on green subsidies is also raising concerns about a new era of protectionism, fueling fears that competing industrial policies will fray global ties, hurt trade and reduce necessary collaboration.Here's what you need to know about the rivalry and its potential consequences.What are subsidies?Subsidies are monetary benefits awarded to companies that a government or public body wants to help, in theory because their work benefits the public or has strategic importance. This can take the form of a tax break, a cash grant or loans at below-market rates. Even government procurement deals can function as subsidies if a government agency offers to pay extra for goods or services it could have acquired more cheaply elsewhere.""The idea is governments can do something that the markets aren't doing themselves,"" said Stephanie Rickard, a political science professor at the London School of Economics and the author of ""Spending to Win,"" a book on subsidies. ""Either there's a technology that's not being created or adopted, or there's an industry that's not growing at the rate it might be.""Critics argue that governments, which have their own political motivations, aren't good at picking winners and losers. But with the state taking a much bigger role in the economy since the pandemic, supporters say subsidies have a vital role in tackling the climate crisis. They also note that fossil fuel producers have benefited from them for decades.Why are green subsidies popular?One of the biggest hurdles in efforts to address climate change is the ""green premium,"" or the difference between what it costs to buy a product or service that uses clean energy versus one with heavy emissions.This premium is expected to shrink as clean energy technologies become more advanced and infrastructure to produce them is scaled up. In the meantime, though, it's dissuading businesses from choosing greener options, even when they're available.That's where companies think government aid can help. They see it as a means to supercharge activity in the private sector and help bring costs down.""Innovations need that push in the beginning,"" said Nils Aldag, CEO of Sunfire, a German company that builds technology for producing green hydrogen. ""They need that market opening.""What's in the Inflation Reduction Act?Most of the money the IRA has earmarked for clean energy initiatives comes in the form of tax credits. An estimated $43 billion is available for consumers and $216 billion for corporations, according to McKinsey.American households can now claim a credit of up to $2,000 for installing an electric heat pump, for example. A credit of up to $7,500 is available for the purchase of a new electric vehicle — though this may require the rewiring of supply chains, given coming stipulations that eligible vehicles need be built in North America, with batteries and components also from North America. There's $2 billion in grants included to expand domestic manufacturing capacity as demand grows.The law also gives generous tax incentives to businesses that invest in green energy projects, from wind and solar farms to facilities for battery storage and producing renewable hydrogen. Companies have already announced at least $40 billion in capital investment for such projects, along with 20 new facilities or facility expansions, according to the American Clean Power Association, an industry group.This all sounds great. What's the problem?Leaders in Europe have applauded renewed US leadership on climate, but have complained that the IRA is ""super aggressive"" and even discriminatory. They fear the IRA is tempting green energy businesses from their countries to invest in the United States instead of in their home markets, resulting in a loss of expertise, jobs and tax revenue. Domestic firms that stay put could fall behind as American companies leverage subsidies to quickly ramp up operations.""A lot of investors are asking us why we are keeping our operations here,"" said Heike Freund, chief operating officer at Marvel Fusion, a German startup developing technology to produce clean energy from fusion power.The European Union has also argued that the IRA's conditions on tax credits for electric cars violate World Trade Organization rules.""This nationalistic approach when it comes to the local content requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act is what generates the tension,"" said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.While the European Union's outcry has been the loudest, it's not the only worried party. The United Kingdom, South Korea and Japan have also raised concerns.How are they responding?One challenge for European leaders is how to loosen rules on state aid without creating a new competition for subsidies between member states. That could weaken a core pillar of Europe's vast internal market.In the meantime, government officials are lobbying the United States to rethink parts of the IRA.""There is still a fair chance to reach agreements that will allow European industry to participate [in], and not be excluded from, the Inflation Reduction Act,"" German Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters during a visit to Washington this week with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.The White House, for its part, emphasizes that the IRA will benefit all countries by reducing the cost of green technologies. It says talks with foreign partners are ongoing.""Europe and other allied countries have nothing to fear from the Inflation Reduction Act and quite a bit to gain,"" said Brian Deese, Biden's top economic adviser.Why does it matter?While greater funding for clean energy production and green technologies is essential, a fight over subsidies runs the risk of focusing too much on geography and not enough on the bigger picture. If a gigafactory that would have been built in Germany is simply stood up in South Carolina instead, that doesn't make the world more likely to hit its emissions targets, said Aaron Cosbey, a senior associate at the International Institute for Sustainable Development.The fight over green subsidies also comes as geopolitical tensions are pushing countries to focus on greater localization of production — not just for green energy, but also for sensitive technologies like computer chips. China's subsidies for net-zero sectors ""have long been twice as high as those in the EU"" relative to the size of the economy, the European Commission said when outlining its new industrial plan.This could accelerate the remaking of supply chains and the global economy over the long term, as national interests trump commitments to open markets.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the WTO, has warned against this shift, arguing that a subsidy arms race could damage global trade at a moment when it's needed to spur growth.""Let's not make it [a subsidy war] a reality because of the cost to the global economy,"" Okonjo-Iweala told CNN's Richard Quest in January.— Ella Nilsen contributed reporting."
33,South Africa's energy crisis poses 'existential threat' to its economy,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/economy/south-africa-economy-energy-crisis-president/index.html,"Setting out the government's key objectives for the year in a state of the nation address Thursday, Ramaphosa said the crisis is ""an existential threat to the economy and the social fabric of our country"" and that ""our most immediate priority is to restore energy security.""South Africans have endured power cuts for years, but 2022 saw more than twice as many blackouts as any other year, as aging coal-fired power plants broke down and state-owned power utility Eskom struggled to find the money to buy diesel for emergency generators.Blackouts in South Africa — or load-shedding as they're known locally — have been lasting for as long as 12 hours a day. Last month, people were even advised to bury the dead within four days after the South African Funeral Practitioners Association warned that mortuary bodies were decomposing because of the constant electricity outages.Growth is plungingThe intermittent power supply is hobbling small businesses and jeopardizing economic growth and jobs in a country where the unemployment rate already stands at 33%.South Africa's GDP growth is likely to more than halve this year to 1.2%, the International Monetary Fund has forecast, citing power shortages alongside weaker external demand and ""structural constraints.""  Ramaphosa said Thursday that the national state of disaster would begin with immediate effect. That would allow the government ""to provide practical measures to support businesses,"" and ringfence power supply for critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and water treatment plants, he added. Ramaphosa, who was forced to cancel a trip to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January as a result of the rolling blackouts, also said he would appoint a minister of electricity with ""full responsibility for overseeing all aspects of electricity response.""In addition, the president unveiled anti-corruption measures Thursday ""to guard against any abuses of funds needed to attend to this disaster,"" and a dedicated South African police service team to ""deal with the pervasive corruption and theft at several power stations."" The vast majority of South Africa's electricity is supplied by Eskom via a fleet of coal-fired power stations that have been overused and under-maintained for years. Eskom has very little backup power, which makes it difficult to take units offline to perform crucial maintenance work.The utility has lost money for years and, despite steep tariff increases for customers, still relies on government bailouts to remain solvent. Years of mismanagement and systematic corruption are believed to be the key reasons why Eskom has been unable to keep the lights on.A wide-ranging commission of inquiry led by Judge Raymond Zondo into corruption and fraud in the public sector in South Africa concluded that members of Eskom's former board should face criminal prosecution due to management failures and a ""culture of corrupt practices.""— Rebecca Trenner contributed reporting."

35,Abe exposes Trump's thought process ahead of US-North Korea summit in posthumous memoir,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/shinzo-abe-memoir-trump/index.html,"In his posthumously published book ""Abe Shinzo: Kaikoroku,"" Abe details his meetings with Trump and exposes the then-president's thought process when it came to negotiations with North Korea and strategic defense matters in Asia. ""I kept telling him, 'What Kim Jong Un fears most is that suddenly a Tomahawk shot will cost him his life, his family's life. I kept telling Trump that only the US can put pressure on him to use force,'"" Abe writes in his Japanese language memoir, according to an English translation. Abe recalled that there were concerns that Trump would convey to Kim, the North Korean leader, that he was reluctant to take military action, and both Abe and Trump's national security team were keen to make sure that the world did not find out about it.""If Kim Jong Un finds out that Trump is someone who is reluctant to take military action, then the pressure will be off. So we had to make absolutely sure that the outside world was not aware of it. We had to make the North Koreans think, 'If it comes to Trump, he'll do it.' Not only me but also the US security team was desperate to keep Trump's true nature under wraps,"" Abe writes.In his memoir, Abe shares that he told Trump that North Korea should destroy ""not only nuclear weapons but also ICBMs, medium-range missiles and biological weapons ... but he did not listen. For him, diplomacy is a new field and he has not been involved in North Korean affairs for many years. The US State Department, the White House security team and I could not stop Trump from thinking about making history.""John Bolton, who was Trump's national security adviser at the time, confirmed Abe's account and said the late prime minister repeatedly emphasized the importance of portraying a US military threat to Kim. Bolton said he and his Japanese counterpart were in regular contact throughout his tenure.""There's no chance that you get North Korea to denuclearize if they think there's no military threat and Abe said that to Trump in every meeting he had with him,"" Bolton told CNN. ""I'm grateful for the reference, but I don't think it took us for Abe to understand what he needed to do. And he was absolutely right. Trump needed to hear it repeatedly.""Trump's team did not return request for comment. Trump has repeatedly said that his ""maximum pressure"" strategy with North Korea is what brought Pyongyang  to the negotiating table during his presidency, though no deal on denuclearization was ever reached.     Abe said that one of Trump's powers in negotiating was that he was seen as the person on the international stage who would be most likely to use military force. ""I think people are wary that Trump is the type of person who would suddenly use military force in the international community,"" he writes.If those actions would cost the US a lot of money, though, Trump was unlikely to react the same way, according to the former prime minister. ""He is a businessman at heart, so he was cautious about things that cost money. He thinks about diplomacy and security in terms of money,"" Abe writes. ""When the US military dispatched an aircraft carrier strike group around the Sea of Japan in 2017, Trump initially asked me, 'Do you know how much it costs to move an aircraft carrier? I don't like it.' He said, 'I would rather keep the aircraft carrier in the military port,'"" Abe writes.Trump was also reluctant to keep funding military drills with South Korea, Abe writes, quoting Trump as saying, ""The joint military exercises between the US and South Korea cost a huge amount of money. It is a waste. It should be stopped.""Abe thought this would have an effect on negotiations at the US-North Korea summit and told Trump: ""We can't have the US troops in South Korea withdrawn, if you are going to have a US-North Korea summit.""The book -- released this week -- contains interviews that were conducted by two journalists from October 2020 to October 2021. Abe died in July 2022 after being shot while giving a campaign speech on a street in central Japan. The book was originally scheduled to be published a year ago. However, the book reveals that Abe had requested that the publication be postponed as it was too sensitive. It is said that his wife, Akie Abe, agreed to the memoir's publication. "
36,"Long-term exposure to air pollution may raise risk of depression later in life, study says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/health/pollution-depression-seniors-wellness/index.html,"Scientists are finding more and more evidence that people who live in polluted areas have a higher risk of depression than those who live with cleaner air. But this study published Friday in JAMA Network Open is one of the first to examine the associations between long-term exposure and the risk of depression diagnosed after age 64.Depression itself is a serious health condition. When it develops in an older adult, it can also contribute to problems with the ability to think clearly, studies show, as well as physical problems and even death.  Previous research has found that a new diagnosis of depression is less common among older adults than in younger populations. ""That's one of the biggest reason we wanted to conduct this analysis,"" said Dr. Xinye Qiu, co-author of the new study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open. Qiu is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Surprisingly, we saw a large number of late-onset depression diagnoses in this study.""The researchers looked at information on more than 8.9 million people who got their health insurance through Medicare and found that more than 1.52 million were diagnosed with depression later in life during the study period of 2005 to 2016. But the number is probably an undercount; studies show that late-in-life depression is often underdiagnosed. To determine the study participants' pollution exposure, Qiu and her co-authors looked at where each of the people diagnosed with depression lived and created models to determine the exposure to pollution at each ZIP code, averaged across a year. The researchers looked at the study participants' exposure to three kinds of air pollution: fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5 or particle pollution; nitrogen dioxide; and ozone.Particle pollution is the mix of solid and liquid droplets floating in the air. It can come in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke. Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants create it, as do cars, agriculture, unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfires.PM2.5 is so tiny -- 1/20th of a width of a human hair -- that it can travel past your body's usual defenses.Instead of being carried out when you exhale, it can get stuck in your lungs or go into your bloodstream. The particles cause irritation and inflammation and may lead to respiratory problems. Exposure can cause cancer, stroke or heart attack; it could also aggravate asthma, and it has long been associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety.Nitrogen dioxide pollution is most commonly associated with traffic-related combustion byproducts. Nitrogen oxides are also released from traffic, as well as through the burning of oil, coal and natural gas. Exposure can increase inflammation of the airways, cause coughing or wheezing and reduce lung function.Ozone pollution is the main ingredient in smog. It comes from cars, power plants and refineries. This particular pollution is best known for exacerbating asthma symptoms, and long-term exposure studies show a higher risk of death from respiratory diseases  in people with higher exposures. The American Lung Association calls it one of the ""least well-controlled pollutants in the United States,"" and it's one of the most dangerous.In the new study, the scientists found that people who lived in areas with higher pollution levels long-term had an increased risk of a depression diagnosis. All three of the pollutants studied were associated with a higher risk of late-onset depression, even at lower pollution levels.""So there's no real threshold, so it means future societies will want to eliminate this pollution or reduce it as much as possible because it carries a real risk,"" Qiu said.There were greater associations between depression and exposure to particle pollution and nitrogen dioxide among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. That may in part be because they are simultaneously exposed to social stress and these poor environmental conditions, the study says.Older adults who had underlying problems with their heart or breathing were also more sensitive to developing late-in-life depression when exposed to nitrogen dioxide pollution, the study found. The study has some limitations. The majority of the participants were White, and more research would be needed to see whether there would be a difference among diverse populations.This is also a population-level study, so there is no way to pinpoint exactly why people exposed to these kinds of air pollutions would have a higher risk of depression. Other studies have found that exposure to air pollution may affect the central nervous system, causing inflammation and damaging the body's cells.Some air pollution, studies show, can also cause the body to release harmful substances that can hurt the blood-brain barrier, the network of blood vessels and tissues made up of closely spaced cells that protect the brain, and that may lead to depression and anxiety. Because aging can impair the immune response, older adults may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of air pollution. More research will be needed to fully understand these connections, as the neural basis for depression is not completely understood. Another possibility may be that people who live in polluted areas develop physical problems that are associated with worsening psychiatric health, the study said. ""Late-life depression should be a geriatric issue that the public and researchers need to be paying more attention to, like on a similar level with Alzheimer's and other neurological conditions,"" Qiu said. She is particularly concerned about the effects that climate change will have on this phenomenon. Ozone pollution will increase as the world gets warmer, and the study found that ozone pollution had a stronger association to late-onset depression than particle and nitrogen dioxide pollution. ""Because of this concerning effect we are seeing with ozone, it makes more sense for the government to put some regulation on pollution and also climate mitigation, because rising temperatures and ozone pollution are definitely linked to each other,"" Qiu said.

37,The Yanomami people lived in harmony with nature. Invaders turned their lives into a fight for survival.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/americas/brazil-yanomami-mining-crackdown-intl-latam/index.html,"Davi has been an activist for Brazil's Yanomami people, one of the largest relatively isolated indigenous groups in South America, for nearly 40 years -- braving threats on his life for his work. Last week, he was invited to Manhattan for the opening of a group exhibition of Yanomami artists and Brazilian photographer Claudia Andujar at cultural center The Shed, which counted among its guests United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. Despite the glamor of the surroundings, Davi's mind was more than 2,000 miles away, deep in the forests of Brazil, where a health crisis has gripped his people. ""I'm in mourning...for my people, who I've lost,"" he said, referring to recent images that emerged from the territory showing emaciated Yanomami adults and children, some with swollen bellies from hunger. Disease and malnutrition have torn through Yanomami villages over the last four years -- a crisis that experts lay at the feet of the scores of illegal miners who have set up camp in their sprawling territory, spurred by the high price of gold.  Yanomami children are dying at a disproportionate rate from preventable diseases, like malaria and malnutrition. At least 570 Yanomami children have died from preventable causes since 2018, Brazil's health ministry told CNN. Fiona Watson, research and advocacy director at indigenous human rights group Survival International, said high malaria rates -- spread by miners -- have left many Yanomami adults too unwell to hunt or fish, as they rely entirely off the forest and rivers for food. ""That means the food's not coming in, hence you get so much malnutrition (that) has led to this terrible catastrophe,"" she said. Their predicament is exacerbated by water pollution and environmental destruction from the mines, and sometimes violent encounters with the intruders. In January, Ariel Castro Alves, Lula's National Secretary for the Rights of Children and Adolescents, said a federal government delegation were told in January that at least 30 Yanomami girls and teenagers had been abused and impregnated by miners. Government health workers, who might have mitigated the crisis, have been intimidated and even driven out of the area by miners who took over health facilities and airstrips, Junior Hekurari Yanomami, president of the Urihi Yanomami Association, told CNN.The emergency is the latest test for Brazil's newly inaugurated President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has made environmental protection a priority for his term in office. In January, he launched a crackdown on illegal mines in Yanomami territory, and the country's military, environmental agencies and police forces are currently sweeping through the area to clear it of miners.Lula's administration has brought hope, says Davi, especially through his appointment of the country's first minister for indigenous people, Sonia Guajajara.""But he's going to need a lot of support,"" the activist said of Brazil's bitterly polarized political landscape.   A gold rush emboldened by Bolsonaro Yanomami territory, which spans the Brazilian states of Roraima and Amazonas, is supposed to be a protected reservation where mining is illegal. But miners have flooded the area over the last several years as gold prices boomed, stripping the natural environment and in some cases driving away vital health workers.While it is hard to get an accurate number of mines in the sprawling territory, which equals the size of Portugal, a report by  Brazilian NGO Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), based on satellite imaging, found that mines on Yanomami land had risen from four in 2015 to 1,556 by the end of 2021.As hunter-agriculturalists, the Yanomami maintain a symbiotic relationship with their environment. Some 30,400 Yanomami live in the territory, and as they are largely isolated from the outside world, they are more vulnerable to common viruses. Exploitation and encroachment in the forest by extractive industries has proven to be fatal for the indigenous group and their traditional way of life. The building of the Trans Amazonian highway, started in the 1970s by the Brazilian military dictatorship who were keen to develop the Amazon basin, introduced measles, malaria and the flu that decimated Yanomami communities, said Watson.A goldrush in 1986 later saw an estimated 20% of the Yanomami community die in a seven-year period, according to Watson. Many of those miners were driven out in 1992, when the area was demarcated by the government of then-President Fernando Collor de Mello. Davi says he noticed a shift when former President Jair Bolsonaro was in power. Miners felt emboldened to enter the territory armed ""with a lot of heavy equipment, the mechanised dredgers, and they were using petrol, mercury, and then they... used planes and small landing strips and helicopters,"" Davi said.The arrival of new miners brought misery, said Davi, including reported threats and attacks against Yanomami communities. In May 2021, a half-hour shootout with miners left four dead, including two Yanomami children --  a video of the incident showed women and children running for cover as a boat passed the riverbanks of their village.""It's his fault. He let the illness of mining in,"" Davi says of Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro has called accusations that he turned a blind eye to the Yanomami plight a ""left-wing farce"" on his official Telegram channel on January 21. Having visited the region before, he shared pictures of him with indigenous people on his Telegram account as well as government press releases from his presidency, including one saying the World Health Organization praised the vaccination rate of Brazil's indigenous people under his government in 2021. During his term from 2019 to 2022, Bolsonaro signed an environmental protection decree to raise fines for illegal logging, fishing, burning, hunting, and deforestation. His administration also saw Brazil's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) -- a government agency that oversees policies related to indigenous communities -- invest $16 million in surveillance of indigenous lands to combat illegal activities there.However, the far-right leader also supported legislation to open indigenous protected areas to mining, reduced funding or dismantled agencies tasked with monitoring and enforcing environmental regulations, and repeatedly claimed that indigenous territories are ""too big"" -- all of which emboldened trespassers, experts say. Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered an investigation to determine whether the actions of the Bolsonaro government amounted to ""genocide"" of the Yanomami. Ahead of Lula's meeting with President Joe Biden on Friday, he reiterated to CNN that Bolsonaro could be ""punished"" by courts for ""the genocide against the Yanomami indigenous people.""On January 30, Brazil's Ministry of Human Rights and Citizenship (MDHC) also released a report on alleging that its previous administration disregarded numerous alerts made about the Yanomami's deteriorating situation. CNN has reached out to Damares Alves, who led MDHC at the time. When asked about the claims by a Brazilian reporter on February 1, Alves responded: ""The Yanomami have been living in a calamitous situation for decades. It's time for the people (the Senate) to change the union's budget so that we can take better care of the Yanomami Indians. As for the accusations, I will only speak when cited by a court"".Brazil cracks down on illegal miningThere has been momentum since Lula's intervention in the territory. Speaking from Boa Vista in late January, Lula pledged to eliminate illegal mining, saying he was ""shocked"" by the Yanomami's poor health. More than 1,000 unwell indigenous people have been evacuated from the Yanomami territory, and the Justice Ministry announced a major offensive against the miners, and closed the territory's airspace as it tackles their supply routes. On Monday, Brazilian security forces began their enforcement operation to expel the miners, many of whom may have already left the area. Videos have emerged on social media of miners fleeing from the territory or imploring the government to help them leave the area. Last week, Justice Minister Flavio Dino said he expected 80% of the illegal miners to have left the first week of February.A miner, who was seen leaving the area, told Reuters that the Yanomami were desperate for food parcels dropped by Air Force planes. ""The day the parcels arrived, they were gone,"" Joao Batista Costa, 65, told Reuters, while holding up a food parcel. But resolving the crisis will be a long road, and Lula is likely to face resistance among parts of the sizeable number of Brazilians who support Bolsonaro's policies. Nor are all politicians on a regional level as enthused about indigenous protections; Roraima state governor Antonio Denarium, a Bolsonaro ally, for example, appeared to downplay the Yanomami crisis in an interview to Folha de S. Paulo newspaper in January, saying it was time for them to adapt to urban living and  ""leave the bush."" In a later statement to CNN, Denarium's office said the quotes were ""taken out of context,"" adding that ""the desire for people's lives to improve is the desire of anyone who values the dignity of indigenous or non-indigenous people.""For Davi, there has been little evidence that authorities valued Yanomami dignity in recent years.""We indigenous peoples are badly treated, as are our rivers, the animals -- but it's not just indigenous peoples who are dying, the city people are suffering as well,"" Davi said from his hotel room. ""These two worlds really need to come together in a big embrace and not let our world be ruined."""
38,Alleged gang rape in the 'Central Park' of Pakistan sparks protests,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/asia/pakistan-rape-ban-television-coverage-intl-hnk/index.html,"The woman, 24, was with a male colleague in the capital Islamabad's Fatima Jinnah park -- known locally as F9 park and the largest in the city -- last Thursday when they were allegedly attacked by two armed men, according to a statement she filed with the police, seen by CNN. The woman alleged the men forced the pair toward a ""jungle area"" of the park where they ripped off her clothes and raped her. She said the men told her she should not have been in the park at night and asked about her connection to her colleague.""When I responded, I was slapped. My hair was pulled and I was thrown on the floor,"" the woman said in her police statement. The incident has sparked outrage in the country of 220 million, which is highly patriarchal and where violent attacks against women and girls frequently make headlines. Scores of protesters have tied their dupattas -- scarves worn by South Asian women -- to the railings of the park, alongside messages imploring change.""Please don't let another sister suffer,"" one note read. ""Save the women and kids of Pakistan,"" read another.The rights group, Aurat Azadi March (Women's Freedom March), said in a statement, ""There is an increasing sexual barbarism in Pakistan, and criminal silence on it by the state and society is unacceptable.""  ""We are enraged. We are in pain. And we will not let this be forgotten."" A spokesperson for Islamabad police told CNN no arrests had been made in the case so far.Fatima Jinnah park is a sprawling oasis spread across the center of Islamabad in an affluent part of the city, and has a high security presence. It is often likened to New York's Central Park as families often gather for festivals and children play at the park throughout the day. Media ban and rape crisisThe government on Sunday ordered domestic television channels not to report on the alleged assault, citing the need to protect the woman's identity.In a statement, Pakistan's Electronic Media Regulatory Authority said any broadcast of news reports was ""prohibited with immediate effect."" More than 5,200 women reported being raped in the country in 2021, according to Pakistan's Human Rights Commission, but experts believe the actual number is much higher as many women are afraid to come forward due to social stigma and victim blaming.Fewer than 3% of sexual assault or rape cases result in a conviction in Pakistan, Reuters reported in December 2020, citing Karachi-based non-profit War Against Rape.In December 2020, Pakistan toughened its rape laws to create special courts to try cases within four months and provide medical examinations to women within six hours of a complaint being made. But activists say Pakistan continues to fail its women and does not have a nationwide law criminalizing domestic violence, leaving many vulnerable to assault.In 2021, the beheading of Noor Mukadam, a Pakistani ambassador's daughter, sent shockwaves through the country with protesters calling on the government to do more to protect women.Her killer, Zahir Jaffer, the 30-year-old son of an influential family and a dual Pakistan-US national who knew Mukadam, was sentenced to death by an Islamabad judge last February."

40,UK avoided recession last year by narrowest of margins. It might not be so lucky in 2023,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/economy/uk-economy-gdp/index.html,"Gross domestic product (GDP) had fallen 0.2% in the July-September quarter, and two consecutive quarters of contraction would have pushed the country into a recession. GDP for the October-December period showed zero growth, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Friday.For the whole of 2022, the economy grew by 4%, following an expansion of 7.6% in 2021. Its performance is likely to deteriorate sharply this year: the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the United Kingdom will be the only major economy to contract in 2023. And last week, the Bank of England forecast a 0.5% decline in UK economic output this year, broadly in line with the IMF's prediction.Looking through the details of Friday's data, commentators saw the glass as half-empty.  ""No recession on the pedantic definition of two consecutive quarters of falling GDP, but a calamitous performance nonetheless,"" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, tweeted. ""The UK still is the 'only' G7 country in which GDP has not exceeded its pre-Covid peak yet.""Similarly, David Bharier, head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, pointed out the ""worrying"" fall in the production sector in the fourth quarter and the 0.5% fall in UK GDP in December. ""Small businesses have seen three years of economic shocks, including lockdowns, global supply chain crises, Brexit and soaring energy costs,"" he said. Strikes are hurtingOutput in the United Kingdom's dominant services sector stagnated in the fourth quarter, dragged down by a 0.8% fall in December, a month that saw widespread strikes.    There was ""anecdotal evidence"" that rail and postal strikes had hit some businesses, the ONS said. Public services were also negatively affected by walkouts in December, noted Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics.Industrial action is likely to dent economic output in the current quarter as well. On February 1, as many as half a million workers walked out across Britain in what unions said was the biggest single day of strikes in more than a decade. Thousands of ambulance workers and university staff are also on strike Friday.Most workers taking part in the wave of strikes sweeping the country have demanded higher pay as soaring prices have decimated living standards. In its fight with inflation — which stood at 10.5% in December — the Bank of England has been hiking interest rates, constraining economic activity. UK consumers are particularly sensitive to rate rises as many have variable-rate mortgages that become more expensive as interest rates rise."
41,White House says Biden's Super Bowl interview with Fox is off,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/media/biden-fox-news-super-bowl/index.html,"Earlier Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Fox had pulled the plug on the administration's proposal to give an interview with Fox Soul, a small streaming platform aimed at Black Americans. ""The President was looking forward to an interview with Fox Soul to discuss the Super Bowl, the State of the Union, and critical issues impacting the everyday lives of Black Americans. We've been informed that Fox Corp has asked for the interview to be cancelled,"" Jean-Pierre said in a tweet Friday.Hours later, Fox said it would interview the president after all, claiming there had been a mixup with the White House. Fox said its reporters had flown to Washington from Los Angeles earlier in the day to conduct the interview. But Friday night, the administration said the interview was still off.""As we said earlier, we had arranged an interview with Fox Sports Host Mike Hill & Vivica A. Fox with the President ahead of the Super Bowl and Fox Corp had the interview cancelled,"" a White House spokesperson told CNN. ""Fox has since put out a statement indicating the interview was rescheduled, which is inaccurate.""Typically, such interviews are pre-taped on the Friday before the Super Bowl with the network airing the event. For weeks, Fox News had been seeking an interview with Biden. But the White House never committed to one with the right-wing channel, with which the White House has a contentious relationship.Instead, the White House attempted to circumvent Fox News by trying to set up an interview with Fox Soul. An interview with the Fox Soul network could have allowed the White House a workaround to still participate in the traditional pre-game conversation with a Fox-aligned outlet without having to sit with one of Fox News' anchors or reporters. Biden's Fox News snub was the latest example of the Democratic president continuing to ice out the right-wing channel and decline requests to sit down with its hosts and anchors.Biden has not granted Fox News a single interview during his presidency, despite the network repeatedly asking. The channel portrays him and his administration in a negative light, with far-right personalities such as Tucker Carlson regularly launching vicious attacks on Biden.Fox Corp. on Thursday had not been formally turned down, but was ""operating like it's not happening,"" according to a person familiar with the matter at Fox News, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the interview.Biden sat down for two television interviews earlier in the week, one with PBS NewsHour and another with Telemundo, which makes the snub all the more notable.There is some recent precedent for declining the traditional pre-Super Bowl interview. President Donald Trump, who villainized the press with lies and smears, declined to sit down with anchor Lester Holt when NBC hosted the Super Bowl in 2018.If Biden were to have done an interview with Fox News ahead of the Super Bowl, it would almost certainly have been with Bret Baier, who is a generally respected, traditional news anchor.It's not just the right-wing commentators at Fox News with whom Biden has taken issue. The president has even tangled with Fox News' reporters, calling Peter Doocy, its White House correspondent, a ""stupid son of a bitch"" last year. Biden later called Doocy to apologize."
42,Scientists fear a Great Toxic Dustbowl could soon emerge from the Great Salt Lake,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/us/utah-great-salt-lake-dust-pollution-weir-wxc/index.html,"When lake levels hit historic lows in recent months, 800 square miles of lakebed were exposed -- soil that holds centuries of natural and manmade toxins like mercury, arsenic and selenium. As that mud turns to dust and swirls to join some of the worst winter air pollution in the nation, scientists warn that the massive body of water could evaporate into a system of lifeless finger lakes within five years, on its way to becoming the Great Toxic Dustbowl.""This is an ecological disaster that will become a human health disaster,"" warned Bonnie Baxter, director of the Great Salt Lake Institute at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah. ""We know about dust storms, we know about particulate pollution, we know about heavy metals and how they're bad for humans,"" she told CNN. ""We see a crisis that is imminent."" As a so-called ""terminal lake,"" Great Salt Lake is fed by rain, snow and runoff but with no rivers to take water to the ocean, salt and minerals build up over time. Only brine flies and shrimp can survive in the salty water, creating a unique ecosystem that supports 10 million migratory birds. With only sail boats and paddleboards navigating the lake, it is so peaceful, 80,000 white pelicans annually nest on islands without fish. But as the water evaporates without replenishment, the yacht basin is all mud, predators can walk to the pelican nests and the bottom of the food chain is collapsing. ""You've got the lake shrinking, the habitat is drying up and what water is remaining is too salty for (algae and microbes) to survive,"" Baxter said. She came to Utah to study this biology 15 years ago and soon realized that the fate of the brine shrimp is directly related to the future of Salt Lake City. When she's not teaching biology, she visits schools, retirement homes and farm conventions to spread the word that every drop of water counts -- now more than ever. ""It's not like scientists to be dramatic,"" Baxter laughed, but said there was no hesitation among the nearly three dozen scientists and conservationists who released the frightening report aimed directly at Utah legislators that said the lake was on track to vanish in five years.Others have since joined the call for emergency measures. A new partnership between university researchers and state officials overseeing natural resources, agriculture and food have formed a ""Great Salt Lake Strike Team,"" and released a report this week urging lawmakers to rewrite water law.""We have to get more water to the lake,"" said Steed, executive director of the Janet Quinney Lawson Institute for Land, Water and Air at Utah State University and a co-chair of the strike team. ""For a long time, I don't think that people were sufficiently talking for the lake. Now, I think that we have a lot of people interested, the governor of the state and the legislature.""As a sign of the unifying power of water, he traveled to the campus of rival University of Utah where the rooftop lab of John Lin, professor of Atmospheric Sciences, measures just how closely air and water are related. ""Air quality is bipartisan,"" Lin said.  ""We all want clean air and to do something about it.""The more than 2 million people who live in Salt Lake City and along the Wasatch Front from Ogden to Provo already suffer some of the worst winter air pollution in the country, with tiny particulates forming dense brown clouds. Further drying of the Great Salt Lake could lead to more pollution, Lin and Steed said. As a cautionary tale, they point to California's Owens Lake, which was notoriously drained by developers in the 1920s to build Los Angeles and inspired the watery, 1974 noir ""Chinatown."" By 1926, the terminal lake was dry and producing billowing clouds of fine, toxic dust which became known as ""Keeler fog"" after it forced people in the town of Keeler to relocate.A century later, every time an Angeleno pays a water bill, a portion goes to clean up the mistake with a dust mitigation program run by the city's Department of Water and Power after the city took responsibility. After decades of moving water and gravel to control the dust, the bill for draining Owens Lake is $2.5 billion and rising.""It was human choices that led to that catastrophic event,"" Steed said of California's painful lesson. ""We're looking at the Great Salt Lake in a position right now to where we can avoid that catastrophe, where we don't have to spend those billions of dollars in remediation in the future if we make choices today.""""Obviously, there's fights,"" he said, acknowledging the old ""whiskey is for drinking, water is for fighting"" cliché. ""But what gives me hope is that we're seeing a lot more collaboration than I have seen in my lifetime, especially around something like the Great Salt Lake. There was a time that people thought that 'Any water that makes it there, well, that's just lost water.' Now we're seeing that the stuff that makes it there is actually really important to all of us here,"" Steed said.Moonshot proposals to save the lake include a plan to pipe water from the Pacific -- a costly endeavor both in terms of money and planet-warming pollution. ""The carbon equation is enormous,"" Baxter said, describing the amount of energy it would take to pump billions of gallons 750 miles. ""The expense is enormous. And you would be bringing salt water here, which is actually not what we need. We don't need more salt. We need less salt.""""I think that the cheapest solution is for the state to buy some of the farmers out of their water rights and release some of this water in the natural system,"" she said. ""I know the farmers that I've talked to, they want to be part of the solution. They live here too.""And while she waits for minds to change, Baxter can only hope for snow after recent storms raised the lake level by around a foot. ""But last year we went up a foot and down two and a half feet,"" she shrugged. ""The aquifers are dry so we've got to fill all of that first. So, the direct precipitation into the lake gave us a foot and that's great. But the runoff in the spring might not bring as much water as we hope."""
43,Two dead including child as car rams people at Jerusalem bus stop,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/jerusalem-car-ramming-intl/index.html,"Yaakov Yisrael Paley, 6, and Alter Shlomo Lederman, 20, died Friday at the Ramot intersection, an area Israel considers to be a neighborhood in northern Jerusalem. The boy's brother, 8-year-old Asher Menachem Paley, who was ""critically wounded"" during the attack, died in hospital on Saturday, according to a statement by the hospital, Shaare Zedek.He was pronounced dead after ""many teams from the trauma unit, from the ER, pediatric intensive care, pediatric surgery and neurosurgery fought for many hours for his life,"" according to the statement.The 42-year-old father of Asher and Yaakov was injured in the attack and remains in the hospital in ""moderate"" condition, according to Hadassah Medical Center. His 10-year-old son has been released ""after being treated in the emergency room by the medical team."" Two other people were also injured in the incident.The suspect, who was ""neutralized"" at the scene, according to police, was identified as Hussein Qaraqe, a 31-year-old from east Jerusalem. Local journalists in the neighborhood reported that Israeli police had arrested Qaraqe's wife, father and brother, sharing videos of what they said were the arrests.It occurred on land that Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and then annexed, so Palestinians and many international observers consider it to be a settlement on occupied land.Suspect released from hospital just before attackThe suspect, Qaraqe, had been released from a hospital in Tel Aviv the night before the incident, his uncle told CNN.He had been in hospitalized for a month due to a back injury, said Adnan Qaraqe.""He had a car accident a while ago and severely injured his back which led to more than five surgeries on his spine. He was on very heavy medication and painkillers which affected his nervous system.""Qaraqe said he did not know if the hospital where his nephew had stayed was a mental hospital or whether Hussein was hospitalized for back pain. He said there would be records at his nephew's house that would clarify, but the house has been sealed by Israeli authorities.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave orders on Friday for the house to be sealed and demolished. Residents of Issawiya told CNN that Qaraqe was not the owner of the house, but had rented it.Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir also ordered police checks of vehicles in that neighborhood in the wake of the ramming -- and wanted to go further, he said at the scene of the incident.""I instructed the police to set up roadblocks around Issawiya and stop one by one -- one by one -- and to simply check every vehicle.  I wanted to do a full closure, but there is a legal question about it - and we will discuss it.  In any case, I instructed the police to deploy roadblocks, and they are deploying roadblocks around Issawiya,"" he said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday responded to the incident in a strongly worded statement on Friday, saying, ""We strongly condemn today's terrorist attack on civilians, including children, at a bus stop in Jerusalem and express our condolences to the families of those killed.""""The deliberate targeting of innocent civilians is repugnant and unconscionable. The United States extends our deepest sympathies to the injured, and we stand firmly with them in the face of this attack,"" the statement read."

45,SEC targets 'crypto-staking' in $30 million Kraken settlement,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/tech/sec-crypto-staking-kraken/index.html,"That practice, known as ""staking,"" reflected an unregistered offer and sale of securities, the SEC alleged in a complaint announced Thursday. According to the SEC, Kraken failed to adequately disclose the risks of participating in the program, which had advertised annual yields of as much as 21%. If approved by a court, the settlement marks a potential turning point for cryptocurrency regulation and the SEC's broader efforts to bring the industry under its jurisdiction. But according to cryptocurrency advocates, the SEC clampdown on staking could have wider effects that undermine the US cryptocurrency ecosystem.The SEC complaint zeroes in on a practice that the industry says is vital to supporting the healthy function of some virtual currencies. When investors agree to contribute, or stake, their cryptocurrency tokens, their contributions become part of the computerized, technical process used to validate transactions. Those who do may be rewarded with additional tokens. In its complaint, however, the SEC alleged Kraken failed to notify users about the lack of protections it offered to those who engaged in staking through Kraken's program. The SEC also said Kraken failed to disclose information about the company's health, the fees it charged, or how the company would handle its customers' tokens. ""Investors have had no insight into Defendants' financial condition and whether Defendants have the means of paying the marketed returns — and indeed, per the Kraken Terms of Service, Defendants retain the right not to pay any investor return,"" the complaint said. Kraken's program had offered ""outsized returns untethered to any economic realities,"" said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC's enforcement division, in a statement.As part of the agreement resolving the charges, Kraken said Thursday in a blog post that on top of the $30 million payment, it would ""automatically unstake all U.S. client assets"" that were a part of the program and that its US customers would no longer be eligible to participate in staking. Staking and the associated rewards will continue to be offered for non-US customers, the company said. Kraken is not the only cryptocurrency platform that offers so-called staking-as-a-service. The industry giant Coinbase offers a similar program whose website advertises up to 6% annual returns. Ahead of the SEC settlement announcement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong had tweeted about ""rumors"" of a possible crackdown on staking, which he described as a ""terrible path for the U.S."" and ""a matter of national security"" if restrictions on staking wound up driving cryptocurrency development to other countries. ""Staking is a really important innovation in crypto,"" Armstrong tweeted. ""It allows users to participate directly in running open crypto networks. Staking brings many positive improvements to the space, including scalability, increased security, and reduced carbon footprints.""""Staking is not a security,"" he added."
46,Quake-hit Turkey and Syria face years of rebuilding. Experts say it didn't have to be this way,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html,"Drone footage and satellite imagery have conveyed the stark reality of widespread destruction in an area that straddles two very different nations.The scale of the disaster is enormous. ""We've done a bit of mapping of the size of the affected area,"" said Caroline Holt, director of disasters, climate and crises at the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC). ""It's the size of France.""United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Thursday that ""we haven't yet seen the full extent of the damage and of the humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes,"" while estimates from the World Health Organization suggest up to 23 million people could be impacted by the natural disaster. Once search efforts have ended, attention will turn to longer-term reconstruction. Turkey has suffered earthquakes in the past, and has rebuilt. But how much can be learned from this history and will these lessons be implemented? And will the same efforts be matched across the border?History repeating itself in Turkey The death toll broke the grim milestone of 22,000 on Friday. As it continues to climb, so too have feelings of anger and resentment. Turkey is no stranger to earthquakes and many feel that the government failed to prepare for another catastrophic event.This frustration dogged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as he made a whistle-stop tour of the Kahramanmaras region -- near the epicenter of the deadly earthquake -- on Wednesday and Thursday. Erdogan defended his government's response, admitting to ""shortcomings,"" before stressing that it's ""not possible to be prepared for such a disaster."" He also announced that the government's target was to rebuild ""in one year,"" though experts told CNN it could take much longer.Major earthquakes such as these are infrequent, but many in Turkey are still harrowed by memories of the 1999 Izmit earthquake in the Marmara region.Ajay Chhibber, an economist who was World Bank director for Turkey when that 7.6 magnitude quake struck two decades ago, told CNN that ""it's like a bad movie [that's] come back again."" Similar to this week's event, that tremor struck in the early hours but it occurred in the country's northwest -- a densely populated area closer to Istanbul. He said it lasted around 45 seconds, leaving more than 17,000 dead and an estimated 500,000 people homeless.  Flying into the region in the immediate aftermath, Chhibber told CNN he ""hadn't seen that much devastation before."" He recalled traveling in with the Japanese and German ambassadors at the time, who told him ""this looks to us like World War II."" Buildings ""flattened like pancakes"" were among the apocalyptic scenes Chhibber encountered in 1999. In the city of Golcuk, where a naval base was located, he remembered seeing ""submarines that were tossed up out of the water, lying 300, 400 feet up a mountain."" ""You could see submarines sitting there. It was unbelievable. And what I'm seeing now is just a redo,"" he said.Some may question if the Turkish president's current target of a year for reconstruction is achievable, given he also said that more than 6,000 buildings had collapsed. But Chhibber pointed out that ""Turkey is capable of moving very, very swiftly -- if they can get their act together on this."" Chhibber helped implement a four-part recovery plan in the wake of the 1999 disaster that provided cash to residents, aided in reconstructing infrastructure and housing, established an insurance system and developed an organizational system that cascaded from a national level down to the community for overall coordination efforts. ""Compared to disasters around the world, it was one of the most rapid reconstruction and recoveries that I ever saw,"" Chhibber said. He added that the majority of the work was completed in two years.Ismail Baris, professor of social work at Istanbul's Uskudar University and former mayor of Golcuk at the time of the quake, told CNN in an email that ""in addition to the collapsed private and public buildings, the city's water transport pipes, water supply network, sewage system [and] storm water system were completely destroyed,"" as well as 80% of the city's roads. He added that the full reconstruction of the city took four years.However, much of the reconstruction then was aided by the Turkish army, which was brought in when many local administrations collapsed. Chhibber said this enabled the rubble clearing to be done quickly.""But Izmit is in the heartland of Turkey,"" said Chhibber. Many Kurds live in the areas hit by the earthquake and bringing in the army may cause problems.""This is a huge challenge,"" said Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London. While the army has the personnel and resources, ""they also have the unfortunate history of often abusing their power,"" Kelman told CNN.""The Kurds in that region and many Turks in that region, understandably, would be very hesitant to have the army in the streets even more than they have been,"" he said.Experts said there also needs to be a review of what went wrong. The country has strict rules that came into place after 1999 -- construction regulations were implemented that required the more modern builds to be able to withstand these quakes. Yet many of the apartment blocks within the earthquake zone appeared to have been newly-constructed and still collapsed.Sinan Ulgen, a Turkish former diplomat currently chairing the Istanbul-based Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy, said there had been awareness regarding the preparations that still needed to be done but that ""unfortunately over the past two decades, this has remained mostly on paper.""""There was a special fund with taxes raised for rehabilitation of cities to withstand these types of natural disasters. Some of that money got squandered, didn't go to the right places. And then the lack of enforcement, which is really the big liability,"" Ulgen told UK broadcaster Channel 4. ""The regulations have certainly been improved ... but it's really a matter of enforcing those regulations. And there, Turkey really needs to upgrade its game.""Chhibber too said Turkey hadn't learned enough from the lessons of the past and questioned why there was a failure to enforce building regulations. He said the Turkish government had regularly allowed for so-called ""construction amnesties"" -- essentially legal exemptions that, for a fee, allowed for projects without the necessary safety requirements. The most recent amnesty was passed in 2018. He said building amnesties were ""a huge issue.""""They just go ahead and make the building. They don't follow the code. They know that at some point some politicians -- because they're financing their political parties -- they'll grant them an amnesty. That's a huge problem.""Turkey's justice minister said Friday that investigations into builders in earthquake regions had begun, according to Turkish state media Anadolu. ""As a result, as I said, whoever has faults, negligence or deficiency will be brought to justice and they will be held accountable before the law,"" Bekir Bozdağ said.Syrian crises pile upAcross the border in Syria, rebuilding efforts will be even more complicated. Guterres warned Thursday that Syrians face ""nightmares on top of nightmares,"" and the World Food Programme has described the situation in the northwest of the country as a ""catastrophe on top of catastrophe.""""We have the perfect humanitarian storm in Syria,"" said Caroline Holt, IFRC director for disasters, climate and crises.The UN estimates more than four million people were already dependent on humanitarian aid in the worst-affected parts of rebel-controlled Syria, due to the civil war that has ravaged the country since 2011. When the earthquake struck there, many traumatized residents first wondered if they were being woken by the sound of warplanes once again.""After 12 years of constant pain, suffering and living in a vulnerable context, your ability to withstand -- especially in winter -- the harsh conditions that you're facing [is diminished],"" Holt told CNN. In Syria, political fault lines run deep. Some of the areas most impacted by the earthquake are controlled by the Assad regime, others by Turkish-backed and US-backed opposition forces, Kurdish rebels and Sunni Islamist fighters. These political divisions create logistical knots. Negotiating them will frustrate recovery efforts.""The conflict -- or conflicts -- are much worse in that area of Syria than in that area of Turkey,"" Kelman said. While Turkey has political problems of its own, ""they do have a comparatively strong government and comparatively strong military in comparison to Syria, which is at war,"" he added. Turkey also has greater ""pre-earthquake resources,"" Kelman said. ""Neither country is especially rich, but Turkey at least has that baseline where they've not been in a major conflict dividing the country for 12 years. They have not been isolated through sanctions.""The sanctions have created geopolitical obstacles that humanitarian aid has to maneuver around. The Assad regime insists that all aid to the country, including aid that is meant for areas outside its control, be directed to the capital Damascus. The Syrian government on Friday approved sending aid into rebel territory in the northwest, according to a statement, but provided no timeline for delivery.But the regime has long siphoned off aid intended for rebel-controlled regions. As such, relief workers attempting to clear the rubble depend on resources sent via a single road, the Bab al-Hawa crossing -- the only humanitarian aid corridor between Turkey and Syria.The result is that ""most of the work is done by hand,"" according to Mohammad Hammoud, Syria manager for the Norwegian Red Cross. Hammoud told CNN how Syria lacks the machinery available to Turkey -- and the little machinery they have has no fuel to run on, after supplies from Damascus were shut off. ""We are mainly reliant on manpower,"" he said.These discrepancies mean Syria's recovery is likely to progress along a stunted timeline. Given its lack of coordination, basic questions may go unanswered for some time.""It's about, first of all, removing the debris and the rubble. What do you do with that? It can either become an environmental hazard, or it can become an asset, if you choose to pave roads with it,"" said Holt. The IFRC director estimates that in Turkey much of the recovery work will be done within two to three years. But in Syria, ""we're looking at a five to 10-year frame just to get recovery underway,"" she said.The years aheadWhile disasters like this wreak havoc, they also create opportunities to prevent such havoc being wrought again. There is a man-made part of every natural disaster, according to Chhibber. Earthquakes are inevitable; their effects are not. Chhibber said he saw this point illustrated after the Izmit earthquake in 1999. ""You'd have one building completely erect, the next building completely flat like a pancake."" The same sights can now be seen in Turkey's Gaziantep.For Chhibber, this is the result of choices. ""There is an earthquake, but it need not be a disaster to this scale, unless it's man-made. And the man-made part comes from the lack of a proper building code being enforced. There's no reason these buildings should have collapsed that easily. Some of them were built only a year or two ago,"" he said.Kelman also stressed that disasters create the opportunity for things to be done differently. He hopes the quake can be used as a spur for ""disaster diplomacy,"" which asks ""whether or not dealing with disasters in any way can end conflict and create peace.""However, not all governments choose to take these opportunities.Related article: How to help victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria""We do have examples where people have taken the opportunity to say there has been a disaster, and we want to help people, so let's try to reconstruct in such a way that we are supporting peace,"" Kelman said. ""At the moment, I do not see either government responding in that way, and I do not see the world responding in that way."""
47,"Cockatoos can not only use tools, they can carry whole toolkits to trickier jobs, study shows",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/world/cockatoos-use-toolkits-study-intl-scli-scn/index.html,"Using 10 Goffin's cockatoos, researchers from Austria and the UK made their discovery after carrying out three experiments as published in the journal Current Biology Friday.Goffin's cockatoos are small white parrots native to the Tanimbar Islands in Indonesia. They were chosen after the researchers spotted them using a ""tool set"" in the wild. In this study, cockatoos from the Goffin Lab in Vienna were used. ""We've seen them use a complex tool set (in the wild), but we did not know if they were aware they were using one, or if it was just a chain of single tool uses in a sequence,"" Antonio Osuna Mascaró, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and lead study author, told CNN.Previously, the only non-human animal known to use a toolkit was the chimpanzee, specifically the Goualougo Triangle chimpanzee from the northern Republic of Congo, according to the study.Inspired by the chimpanzees' two-tool, termite-fishing process of making holes in a termite mound with a blunt stick and then inserting a different stick to fish the termites out, Osuna Mascaró and his team devised experimental designs that mimicked this process.Describing the first experiment, Osuna Mascaró said: ""We gave them a problem in which they had to fish cashews out of a box, by first poking a hole in the membrane that blocked it with a short, pointy stick and then getting it out with a longer, flexible stick."" To the researchers' surprise, some of the cockatoos solved the problem very quickly, with one taking just 31 seconds to do so in its first try.Mark Briffa, associate head at the School of Biological and Marine Sciences at the University of Plymouth, told CNN that basic tool use is common in animals, but using ""a tool set implies the ability to solve problems through flexibly applying some insight of a given situation ... (which) this study convincingly shows."" Briffa was not involved in the study.Four cockatoos failed to complete the first experiment successfully, and one dropped out after showing a lack of interest. Five, however, progressed to the next stage of the study. Briffa said it would be interesting to find out why some of the birds failed the task.The second experiment looked at tool use flexibility -- whether or not the cockatoos would choose the right tool or tools for the right task. This was done by randomly giving the cockatoos a box that required either a single tool or two tools to extract the nuts, according to the study. The cockatoos aced this test, too.The final experiment included an extra challenge, the addition of different phases to reach the box of cashews, tools in tow -- climbing, horizontal flight and vertical flight -- to see whether the birds transported one tool at a time or saved energy by taking both together.The box, which was visible to the cockatoos from the outset, required either one tool or both.The researchers saw that four cockatoos were eventually able to transport both tools together when needed, even when flying, with three birds ""remarkably"" managing it consistently.This suggests they learned to take both tools together and saw them as a set, something Briffa said is ""relevant to questions about the evolution of tool use and the cognitive abilities that underpin it.""Overall, Osuna Mascaró said that by showing that cockatoos plan their tool use according to the requirements of the situation, the study is the start of looking at their cognitive abilities.Talking about the next steps, Osuna Mascaró said one possible avenue would be comparing the birds to human children.""We noticed that each cockatoo had a different way of carrying and using the tool sets, which is interesting because cockatoos learned it through play and being curious, like humans do,"" he said.Talking about the wider implications, Briffa said the study is relevant to questions about animal sentience -- the level of awareness and insight animals have about their world."
48,Black history observance began as a single week. It's time for a full season,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/opinions/black-history-more-than-a-month-tisby/index.html,"Black History Month began as a single week, Negro History Week, in 1926 with the vision of Carter G. Woodson. In 1976, it expanded to an entire month as a part of the nation's bicentennial celebrations; since President Gerald Ford, each US president has officially designated February as Black History Month. When we think of Black history in singular terms—a single test, a single class, a single month—we can miss its deeper meanings. Historians speak of ""the long Civil Rights movement"" as a way of thinking more carefully about its precursors and lasting effects. Perhaps it is time to think in terms of a ""long Black History Month.""  My boss, Simmons College president Kevin W. Cosby, recently inspired me to consider the power of taking Black history beyond the confines of February. He told me, ""My Black History Month begins on MLK Day.""  Instantly, his perspective made sense to me. We observe MLK Day nationwide on the third Monday of January. It is one of the most recognized annual traditions related to Black history and the Civil Rights movement. Enormous effort goes into planning MLK Day events each year—speeches, award ceremonies, parades, marches, service opportunities, and more.  Does it make sense to pause the remembrances that accompany MLK Day for two weeks until the start of Black History Month, or would it make more sense simply to continue to the movement of memory for an additional two weeks? Cosby went on to explain that the conclusion of a Black History Season might be April 4, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination. The purpose would not be to dwell on Black death, but to ponder the causes and consequences of an uncompromising insistence on civil and human rights. If we stop to think about the significance of marking an entire month for Black history in America, then we find once again--timing is everything.  The idea of a whole month of Black history was not new. People in West Virginia, where Woodson grew up, had been celebrating ""Negro History Month"" beginning in the 1940s. Black students at Kent State University proposed Black History month in 1969.  A few years later, in 1976, Ford officially declared a national observance of Black History Month. Using 1776 and the Declaration of Independence as the nation's ""founding"", a year of patriotic activities were planned for the country's 200th birthday in 1976. As part of the country's bicentennial celebration, political officials designated the whole month of February for Black history.  In a statement marking the occasion, Ford said, ""In the Bicentennial year of our Independence, we can review with admiration the impressive contributions of black Americans to our national life and culture.""  Ford also connected Black History Month to the stated ideals of freedom which led to the creation of the United States.  ""Freedom and the recognition of individual rights are what our Revolution was all about. They were ideals that inspired our fight for Independence: ideals that we have been striving to live up to ever since. Yet it took many years before ideals became a reality for black citizens."" Contrast that with another Republican: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In January, DeSantis and his administration opposed the AP African American Studies frameworks composed by the College Board. He said the frameworks ""lacked educational value."" This week, correspondence between the College Board and the state of Florida emerged that amplified the tension, which is further complicated by DeSantis's presidential ambitions (and the centrality of his rejection of the study of race and racism to that agenda). People in DeSantis' home state of Florida as well as around the nation have voiced their protest to his actions. They claim that opposing AP African American Studies, the first time it has ever been offered, serves to make information about Black history and other similar fields harder to acquire precisely when it should be more accessible.  Since then, DeSantis' proposals to hinder racial education have gone even further. In late January he announced his plans for higher education that include required courses on Western Civilization and a desire to ""eliminate all DEI [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion] and CRT bureaucracies."" DeSantis is only the symptom of a deeper issue with how we frame Black history. It seems that many people's understanding of Black history is limited to scant details about slavery, Rosa Parks refusing to move on the bus, and a line or two from King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech. This is partly because we tend to think of Black history as an event rather than an ongoing pursuit. Among the many reasons for our nation's lack of Black history knowledge, once again—timing is everything.    Black history cannot be reduced to a set of historical tidbits posted on social media for 30 days. We do a disservice to Black history when we view it as a set of isolated facts rather than as a complex and interwoven series of stories sewn into the diverse tapestry of lives in this land. At its best, Black history is a way of thinking about ourselves and the world in a more inclusive and equitable manner. Black history teaches us to examine life from the perspective of the marginalized and oppressed. It teaches us about survivors, resisters, and creators. Black history develops a mindset that is always asking, ""Who is missing? Whose voices need to be heard?""  I discovered one of my historical heroes, Fannie Lou Hamer, because scholars looked for the people whose lives are usually ignored. Born in 1917, Hamer was the twentieth of twenty children in a Mississippi sharecropping family. She would likely have lived and died in obscurity—another of the anonymous poor—but in 1962 she heard a presentation about voting rights at her local church and became involved in civil rights activism. She soon rose to national prominence and even testified at the Democratic National Convention in 1964.  How many more Hamers are out there? Black history teaches us to scour the past for a narrative that goes beyond the ""victors"" and includes all kinds of stories.  A life informed by Black history takes years to develop. It requires mental, cultural and civic space to reflect on the rich meaning of the stories and events that comprise Black history.   A long Black History Month would offer more space to consider the Black experience. Rather than hustling through mounds of book recommendations, documentaries, quotes and dates—an extra couple of weeks of Black history makes it possible to steep in the knowledge of the past and ponder how it will affect your present.   More than simply revealing what went wrong, studying Black history compels us to ask, ""How can we make it right?""  People who study Black history with humility and consistency begin talking about reparations, expanding voting rights, and allocating more resources to Black institutions. They begin to question an unjust racial status quo and seek progress. They begin to take control of a narrative that has too long been in the hands of a privileged few.  Black history is more than a meme. It is more than a month. It is more than memory. Black history is mindset that leads us into a deeper knowledge of ourselves and our communities. "
49,NORAD says additional 'object' detected over northern Canada,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/politics/norad-additional-object-northern-canada/index.html,"""I ordered the take down of an unidentified object that violated Canadian airspace. @NORADCommand shot down the object over the Yukon. Canadian and U.S. aircraft were scrambled, and a U.S. F-22 successfully fired at the object,"" Trudeau said on Twitter.The object was ""cylindrical"" and smaller than the suspected Chinese balloon shot down last weekend, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said on Saturday evening.Later on Saturday, the White House confirmed that Trudeau and US President Joe Biden authorized the shoot-down and the Pentagon said the object was first spotted over Alaska on Friday evening.Trudeau said that he spoke with Biden on Saturday and that Canadian forces will lead the object recovery operation.The object shot down Saturday marks the third time in one week that US aircraft have shot down an object in North American airspace. Saturday's incident follows the downing of another unidentified object on Friday over Alaska, and the shoot-down of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4 by a US F-22 fighter jet.It is not clear what the object shot down over Canada is or whether it is related to the spy balloon shot down last week or the unidentified object shot down over Alaska on Friday. Both Biden and Trudeau authorized the take-down of the object, a White House readout of a call between the two leaders said on Saturday. And according to the statement regarding the call, the leaders ""discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.""A statement from Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said the object shot down on Saturday was first noticed over Alaska on Friday evening. Two F-22 fighter jets ""monitored the object"" with the help of the Alaska Air National Guard, Ryder's statement said, ""tracking it closely and taking time to characterize the nature of the object.""""Monitoring continued today as the object crossed into Canadian airspace, with Canadian CF-18 and CP-140 aircraft joining the formation to further assess the object. A U.S. F-22 shot down the object in Canadian territory using an AIM 9X missile,"" his statement added.""As Canadian authorities conduct recovery operations to help our countries learn more about the object, the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be working closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,"" Ryder said in his Saturday statement.Anand tweeted Saturday that she had discussed the incident with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ""and reaffirmed that we'll always defend our sovereignty together.""""The object was flying at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, had unlawfully entered Canadian airspace and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight. The object was shot down approximately 100 miles from the Canada-United States border over Canadian territory in central Yukon,"" Anand said in a news conference on Saturday evening.The North American Aerospace Defense Command said earlier Saturday it was monitoring ""a high altitude airborne object"" over northern Canada, and military aircraft were operating in the area from Alaska and Canada, according to a news release from the agency. Global News reported on NORAD's detection of the object earlier Saturday.Airspace over Montana briefly closed before being reopenedAirspace over Montana was also closed on Saturday evening ""to support Defense Department activities,"" according to a FAA spokesperson, but it was quickly reopened. A statement from NORAD later on Saturday night said they ""detected a radar anomaly and sent fighter aircraft to investigate,"" but the aircraft ""did not identify any object to correlate to the radar hits.""On Friday, the US military shot down a ""high-altitude object"" over Alaska after US officials determined that it posed a ""reasonable threat to civilian air traffic"" as it was flying at 40,000 feet. The object was brought down by fighter aircraft assigned to US Northern Command, and Biden referred to the operation as a ""success."" Recovery teams are now attempting to retrieve the debris that is sitting on top of ice in US territorial waters. While officials have given no indication so far that the object shot down over Alaska is at all related to the Chinese spy balloon, details have been scarce. A week earlier, US military fighter jets shot down the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon over the Atlantic Ocean, ending a remarkable public drama that prompted a diplomatic fallout between Washington and Beijing as the American public tracked the balloon from Montana all the way to the Carolinas. The Biden administration has been subjected to a slew of questions this week about the timing of the president's decision to shoot the spy balloon. The balloon was spotted after entering the US Air Defense Identification Zone over Alaska on January 28 before flying over Canada, a Department of Defense official told lawmakers last week. It then reentered continental US airspace three days later. Officials said that the risk of intelligence collection against the US was low, while the risk to people and property on the ground, if the balloon were to be shot down over the US, was high given the balloon's size and weight. Instead, the military ultimately shot it down over water after it crossed over the East Coast of the US.The second object was first spotted on Thursday, officials said, and F-35 fighter jets were sent up to examine the object further. The object was flying at 40,000 feet, which posed a ""reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight,"" John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said on Friday.Biden was first briefed on this object on Thursday evening, Kirby said. A statement Saturday from US Northern Command said search and recovery operations for the object shot down over Alaska were ongoing. ""Recovery activities are occurring on sea ice,"" the statement said. ""We have no further details at this time about the object, including its capabilities, purpose, or origin."" This story and headline have been updated. "
50,The week that tech became exciting again,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/tech/tech-exciting-again/index.html,"Executives in business casual wear trot up on stage and pretend a few tweaks to the camera and processor make this year's phone profoundly different than last year's phone or adding a touchscreen onto yet another product is bleeding edge. But that changed radically this week. Some of the world's biggest companies teased significant upgrades to their services, some of which are central to our everyday lives and how we experience the internet. In each case, the changes were powered by new AI technology that allows for more conversational and complex responses.On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a revamped Bing search engine using the capabilities of ChatGPT, the viral AI tool created by OpenAI, a company in which Microsoft recently invested billions of dollars. Bing will not only provide a list of search results, but will also answer questions, chat with users and generate content in response to user queries. And there are already rumors of another event next month for Microsoft to demo similar features in its Office products, including Word, PowerPoint and Outlook.  On Wednesday, Google held an event to detail how it plans to use similar AI technology to allow its search engine to offer more complex and conversational responses to queries. Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Baidu also said this week that they would be launching their own ChatGPT-style services. And other companies are sure to follow suit soon. After years of incremental updates to smartphones, the promise of 5G that still hasn't taken off and social networks copycatting each others' features until they all the look the same, the flurry of AI-related announcements this week feels like a breath of fresh air. Yes, there are very real concerns about the potential of this technology to spread biases and inaccurate information, as happened in a Google demo this week. And it's certainly likely numerous companies will introduce AI chatbots that simply do not need one. But these features are fun, have the potential to give us back hours in the day and, perhaps most importantly, some are here right now to try out. Need to write a real estate listing or an annual review for an employee? Plug a few keywords into a ChatGPT query bar and your first draft is done in three seconds. Want to come up with a quick meal plan and grocery list based on your dietary sensitivities? Bing, apparently, has you covered. If the introduction of smartphones defined the 2000s, much of the 2010s in Silicon Valley was defined by the ambitious technologies that didn't fully arrive: self-driving cars tested on roads but not quite ready for everyday use; virtual reality products that got better and cheaper but still didn't find mass adoption; and the promise of 5G to power advanced experiences that didn't quite come to pass, at least not yet.But technological change, like Ernest Hemingway's idea of bankruptcy, has a way of coming gradually, then suddenly. The iPhone, for example, was in development for years before Steve Jobs wowed people on stage with it in 2007. Likewise, OpenAi, the company behind ChatGPT, was founded seven years ago and launched an earlier version of its AI system called GPT3 back in 2020.""ChatGPT exploded onto the market and people's awareness,"" said Bern Elliot, an analyst at Gartner, ""but this has been a long time in the making."" More than that, artificial intelligence systems have for years underpinned many of the functions people may now take for granted, from content recommendations on social media platforms and auto-complete tools in e-mail to voice assistants and facial recognition tools. But when ChatGPT was released publicly in November, it put the power of AI systems on full display for millions in an entertaining and immediately graspable way. ChatGPT simultaneously made it much easier to see how far the technology has progressed in recent years and to imagine the vast potential for the impact it could have across industries. ""When new generations of technologies come along, they're often not particularly visible because they haven't matured enough to the point where you can do something with them,"" Elliott said. ""When they are more mature, you start to see them over time — whether it's in an industrial setting or behind the scenes — but when it's directly accessible to people, like with ChatGPT, that's when there is more public interest, fast.""  Now that ChatGPT has gained traction and prompted larger companies to deploy similar features, there are concerns not just about its accuracy but its impact on real people. Some people worry it could disrupt industries, potentially putting artists, tutors, coders, writers and journalists out of work. Others are more optimistic, postulating it will allow employees to tackle to-do lists with greater efficiency or focus on higher-level tasks. Either way, it will likely force industries to evolve and change, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.""New technologies always come with new risks and we as a society will have to address them, such as implementing acceptable use policies and educating the general public about how to use them properly. Guidelines will be needed,"" Elliott said.Many experts I've spoken with in the past few weeks have likened the AI shift to the early days of the calculator and how educators and scientists once feared how it could inhibit our basic knowledge of math. The same fear existed with spell check and grammar tools.While AI tools are still in their infancy, this week may represent the start of a new way of doing tasks, similar to how the iPhone changed computing and communication in June 2007. But this time, it could be in the form of a Bing browser."

52,From scaffolder to the Super Bowl: how Australian Jordan Mailata became an NFL star,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/sport/jordan-mailata-philadelphia-eagles-super-bowl-spt-intl/index.html,"Turns out Jordan Mailata fell on his feet, becoming one of the NFL's best starting left tackles and a vital cog in the Philadelphia Eagles' run to the Super Bowl.The hulking Australian admitted that if he'd been told what his future might hold back when he was doing odd jobs to pay the bills in between playing rugby -- including scaffolding, carpentry and demolition to name a few -- he would've laughed at the notion. ""I'd probably say: 'What shrooms are you taking because I don't know what the Super Bowl is? You're talking about that concert at halftime?'""But that's where 25-year-old Mailata finds himself, one victory away from becoming the first Australian to play in a Super Bowl and win a championship ring. His teammate, Arryn Siposs, is in a similar position as the Eagles punter hails from Melbourne. A changeBorn in a Sydney suburb, rugby league was Mailata's first sport.However, playing rugby wasn't enough to pay the bills, so he tried his hand at all manner of jobs. ""Scaffolder, doing carpentry, demolition, doing whatever I could to pay the bills,"" said Mailata.He played in Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs' Under-18 side -- a professional team -- but in 2014, Mailata collapsed during a preseason session.He was taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with a heart disorder. He subsequently underwent two operations to repair the upper and lower chambers of his heart.Because of his inability to exercise while recovering, Mailata had put on almost 20kg (about 44 pounds) by the time he returned to actionWhen he did make his comeback, it was for the South Sydney Rabbitohs' Under-20 team. But in order to progress, his coaches wanted Mailata to lose 15kg (33 pounds) from his six-foot-eight frame which would allow him to play longer stints on the field given rugby league's free-flowing nature.According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Rabbitohs offered Mailata a one-year, $3,500 deal in 2017 to play for their feeder team with the added clause that they would consider a full-time contract if he lost the weight. Meanwhile, Mailata's management team had put together a highlights package for rugby union clubs to view his talents. It just so happened that this eventually fell into the hands of scouts in the NFL's International Players Pathway Program. Mailata's now legendary highlight reel repeatedly shows a posse of men required to drag him down on the rugby field -- and features one unfortunate player who was bulldozed by a particularly bruising tackle.""I already had hardly any body fat, so it was an option where I'd either have to starve myself or chop off a leg,"" he told the New York Times in 2019. ""I talked to my agency, and they said: 'Why don't you play a sport that appreciates your size?'""So with no NFL experience under his belt, Mailata chose to try his hand at America's game. Learning on the jobLearning a new sport is extremely tough. Learning a sport which hinges on tiny technical details is nigh-on-impossible. There have been many players, in particular ones from abroad, who have struggled to pick up the intricacies of American football and have been forced to give up the game. In his draft report on the NFL website, Mailata was said to ""require an extensive period of development to learn technique and to improve"" and was ""the attacker in rugby and will have to learn to play from defensive posture."" However, in his favor were his physical attributes -- he was described as having ""tremendous size with frame that carries weight well, good musculation and thickness in lower body and very good physical traits and athletic traits."" As part of the International Pathway Program -- aimed at increasing participation in the NFL from around the world -- Mailata was shipped to the IMG Institute in Florida to join four other hopefuls.Their arduous training program -- 12 hours a day, seven days a week -- was filmed for the NFL Network's show ""Undrafted,"" which previously followed Washington Commanders defensive end Efe Obada.Despite his inexperience, the Eagles decided to take a punt on Mailata in the seventh round of the 2018 draft, a year after the team won their first Super Bowl title.He became only the second player to be drafted with no American high school or college experience after Moritz Böhringer. Although Mailata didn't feature during his first two seasons in the NFL, that period allowed him to learn the minutiae of being a top-level offensive tackle.As he learned the ropes of preparing to face the best pass rushers around, Mailata described being faced with an NFL playbook as like reading a ""different language."" In 2020, the Australian finally made his NFL debut, replacing injured rookie Jack Driscoll in the third quarter of a game against the then-Washington Football Team early in the season. He made his first start in Week 4, finishing his first season in the league with 15 appearances and 10 starts. Mailata impressed in his performances, so much so that in 2021, new Philadelphia head coach Nick Sirianni named the Australian as the starter. Mailata was also awarded a four-year, $64 million contract, including $40.85 million guaranteed.Having blossomed into one of the best left tackles in the league, Mailata praised Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland as the key to his meteoric rise.In his 39-year coaching career, Stoutland has been credited with coaching a number of successful offense lineman, including many multi-year Pro Bowlers, notably Jason Peters, Jason Kelce and Lane Johnson. ""He is one of the most influential people in my life, on and off the field,"" said Mailata of Stoutland.""On the field mostly because he's taught me everything ... but just everything he's built in that room is why we're so close. He makes sure we're always on top of our stuff, mentally and physically.""Such is Stoutland's influence on Mailata, the 25-year-old proudly announces he attended the ""Jeff Stoutland University"" during ""Sunday Night Football"" when players introduce themselves and typically state the college they attended. This year, with the help of Stoutland's daughter, Madison Lee, the Eagles designed a ""Jeff Stoutland University"" T-shirt to sell in support of the Eagles Autism Foundation.The shirt features Stoutland's own mantra -- ""hungry dogs run faster"" -- and the date 1984, his inaugural coaching year.Having been named an alternate for the 2022 Pro Bowl after an excellent season with the Eagles, who have possibly the best offensive line in the league, Mailata is now on the cusp of history. Together with Landon Dickerson, Jason Kelce, Isaac Seumalo and Lane Johnson -- Mailata calls them his ""brothers"" -- that quintet has become the bedrock for an almost unstoppable offense with a dynamic running game. Building a culture of ""accountability"" in the offensive line room has also lead to its growth as a group and why the players have become so good at keeping quarterback Jalen Hurts upright. ""What makes it so good is the five guys have to be in sync for the car to go. It's a five-wheel car,"" said Mailata. ""And once you start playing with the guy next to you, you start to get a feel of how to execute the right techniques on the sideline or whether it's in real time right there.""So I think just from that mold right there, from the accountability and being able to look you in the eye and tell you that you messed up or how something isn't feeling right is crucial.""Now, Mailata is just one game away from being crowned a Super Bowl champion.""My dreams only started five years ago. All these guys that I play with, my brothers, they've been dreaming about this since they were kids. And for me, I'm living with them and through them. Just enjoying the moment and taking everything in."" "

A voice shouted ""Death to the Islamic Republic.""Nationwide protests swept Iran following the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police.Security forces have responded with a deadly crackdown to the protests, among the strongest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution ended 2,500 years of monarchy.As part of an amnesty marking the revolution's anniversary, Iranian authorities on Friday released jailed dissident Farhad Meysami, who had been on a hunger strike, and Iranian-French academic Fariba Adelkhah.On Sunday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty covering a large number of prisoners, including some arrested in recent anti-government protests.Rights group HRANA said dozens of political prisoners and protesters, including several prominent figures, had been freed under the amnesty but that the exact conditions of their release were not known.Rights activists have expressed concern on social media that many may have been forced to sign pledges not to repeat their ""offenses"" before being released. The judiciary denied this on Friday.HRANA said that as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors. It said 70 government security forces had also been killed. As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.Iranian leaders and state media had for weeks appealed for a strong turnout at Saturday's rallies as a show of solidarity and popularity in an apparent response to the protests.On the anniversary's eve Friday night, state media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, and people chanting ""Allahu Akbar! (God is Greatest!)."" However, many could be heard shouting ""Death to the dictator!"" and ""Death to the Islamic Republic"" on videos posted on social media.The social media posts could not be verified independently.Government television on Saturday aired live footage of the state rallies around the country.In Tehran, domestic-made anti-ballistic missiles, a drone, an anti-submarine cruiser, and other military equipment were on display as part of the celebrations.""People have realized that the enemy's problem is not woman, life, or freedom,"" Raisi said in a live televised speech at Tehran's Azadi Square, referring to the protesters' signature slogan.""Rather, they want to take our independence,"" he said.His speech was frequently interrupted by chants of ""Death to America"" -- a trademark slogan at state rallies. The crowd also chanted ""Death to Israel.""Raisi accused the ""enemies"" of promoting ""the worst kind of vulgarity, which is homosexuality"".Adelkhah, who had been in prison since 2019, was one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor that has worsened relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.She was sentenced in 2020 to five years in prison on national security charges. She was moved to house arrest later but in January returned to jail. Adelkhah has denied the charges.Meysami's release came a week after supporters warned that he risked dying because of his hunger strike. He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of the hijab. In announcing Adelkhah's release on Friday, the French foreign ministry called that her freedoms be restored, ""including returning to France if she wishes.""""Legally, her file is considered completed, and legally there should be no problem to leave the country, but this issue has to be reviewed. So ... it is not clear how long it will take,"" said her lawyer, Hojjat Kermani."
54,Several rescue operations suspended in Syria and Turkey as chances of survival diminish,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/rescue-operations-suspended-earthquake-intl/index.html,"Germany and Austria have suspended rescue operations in Turkey, citing security concerns. Meanwhile, rescue efforts in the rebel-controlled areas in north and northwest Syria have ended, announced volunteer organization Syria Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, on Friday.After searching for 108 hours, the group said it believes no one trapped under the rubble is still alive.Syria has been ravaged by civil war since 2011, and 4 million people were already reliant on humanitarian aid in the worst-affected parts of rebel-controlled country before Monday's disaster.As many as 5.3 million people in Syria could have been affected by the quake and be in need of shelter support, according to preliminary data from the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, which has been trying to distribute supplies to vulnerable populations.However, the country's political set-up complicated rescue efforts, with some of its most impacted areas controlled by the internationally-sidelined, heavily-sanctioned regime, others by Turkish-backed and US-backed opposition forces, Kurdish rebels and Sunni Islamist fighters.It took three days after the quake struck for the first UN convoy to cross through the Bab al-Hawa crossing, which is the only humanitarian aid corridor between Turkey and Syria.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited rescue teams and civilians in affected regions on Saturday, including injured survivors in a hospital in the city of Latakia.On Friday, he had criticized the lack of humanitarian aid from Western countries, stating that they ""have no regard for the human condition."" The Syrian government approved sending aid into the rebel-held territories Friday but did not provide a specific timeline.Rescue work could take two to three years to complete in Turkey, but five to 10 years to just get underway in Syria, according to Caroline Holt, director of disasters, climate and crises at the International Federation of the Red Cross.Syrian-American actor Jay Abdo expressed frustration on Saturday, telling CNN: ""Earthquakes, they have no borders. So why do borders and politics deprive Syrian civilians in the northwest of the country from their human rights to be rescued?""He called on the international community to ""act immediately"" as ""there's no time"" and ""civilians are not receiving any support, aid or attention.""The World Health Organization's director-general arrived in Syria's earthquake-hit Aleppo city on Saturday on a plane carrying more than $290,000 worth of trauma emergency and surgical kits.'Worst event in 100 years'The extent of devastation is ""unprecedented,"" according to Belit Tasdemir, UN liaison officer at AKUT Search and Rescue Association, who was working in Turkey.He told CNN on Saturday that ""freezing"" temperatures and ""extreme fatigue"" was beginning to affect rescue workers as they approach the end of the rescue window and the probability of finding survivors becomes lower. Some astonishing rescues still provide a glimmer of hope, however. Sezai Karabas and his young daughter were found alive in Gaziantep, southern Turkey, 132 hours after the earthquake struck. A 70-year-old survivor, a woman named Menekse Tabak, was pulled out from the rubble in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, 121 hours after the quake hit.Yet attempts at search and rescue have also been hampered in Turkey.The German Federal Agency for Technical Relief stopped its rescue and relief work due to security concerns in the Hatay region, the organization said in a statement Saturday.German rescue operators, who had been working in coordination with Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD), said they ""will resume their work as soon as AFAD deems the situation to be safe.""The Austrian Army made a similar decision, citing ""increasing aggression between groups in Turkey,"" but said they will ""keep our rescue and recovery forces ready.""Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has warned that those looting and committing other crimes would be punished, and that university dorms would be used to house victims made homeless, with classes going online.United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths described the earthquake in southern Turkey and northwestern Syria as the ""worst event in 100 years"" to hit the regions, and said that a ""clear plan"" to give ""an appeal for a three-month operation"" would be set out on either Sunday or Monday."
55,Border crossings in January drop to lowest point since February 2021,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/border-crossings-january-2023/index.html,"In January, US Border Patrol made more than 128,000 apprehensions, down 42% from December, according to administration officials.The handling of the US-Mexico border has been a political vulnerability for President Joe Biden, who faces criticism from Republicans and potential impeachment proceedings of his Homeland Security secretary. The White House has generally kept the issue at arms length but the drop in border crossings has instilled renewed confidence in administration officials who say new measures are helping drive the decline.In recent weeks, administration officials have cited a new program that provides a legal pathway to the United States as contributing to a drop in border crossings. Encounters with migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela -- the four nationalities that benefit from that program -- have declined dramatically, officials said.""Since the president announced our new border approach on January 5, the number of unlawful border crossings has plummeted,"" an administration official told reporters Friday, adding that there's also been a significant drop in migrants from Central America.Border numbers often fluctuate depending on circumstances in the Western Hemisphere, so it's unclear how long the trend will hold. The administration also continues to rely on a Trump-era Covid restriction, known as Title 42, that allows authorities to turn away certain migrants at the US-Mexico border, though it could expire soon.But officials cited new measures, like the new program and use of an app for processing, along with coordination with Mexico as contributing to the decline in encounters."

See you on 2/12/23."" Oh, and, in a hint that the world may be coming to an end, cockroaches feature prominently in these posts.Another post instructs how to watch the commercial: ""On 2.12.23 visit The Last Blockbuster in Bend, or watch live on our Instagram at halftime.""If you miss it because, of course, Rihanna, the store is also renting VHS copies of it for $2.So what if the ad isn't in the big leagues, like Budweiser or Coca-Cola with a national spot? For this one store, it's an attempt at generating buzz, no matter how big or hyperlocal.And it seems to be working. The store has been getting lots of calls since the teasers surfaced this week. ""Everyone who calls is super excited, and they want to know more,"" said Sandi Harding, the store's general manager, in an interview with CNN Business.""I wanted to do two things with the ad. One was to show that small businesses can also do creative and fun things for Super Bowl, and it's not just an opportunity for the big companies and their big ads,"" she said. ""We also want people to remember us, that we are here and our store is exactly the way a Blockbuster store was in the 1990s.""At one time, Blockbuster operated more than 9,000 stores nationwide renting movies and video games. But the advent of on-demand service like Netflix pushed it out of business.Blockbuster stores fell one by one, with only 10 left in 2017, and then just one.The location in Bend, Oregon is the only evidence left to prove to GenZers that Blockbuster actually did exist, and it's how Americans watched movies at home pre-Netflix.The store regularly uses its status as fun fodder for tens of thousands of its followers on TikTok and Instagram, and it's been the subject, ironically, of a Netflix documentary about its corporate demise.Adding a quirky ad during Super Bowl is just par for the course for this holdout from a bygone era."

Portions of the money were to be used to build a volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi, Favre's alma mater, as well as $1.1 million paid to the former quarterback for a public service announcement campaign, according to investigators.Favre returned $500,000 in May 2020 and repaid the remaining $600,000 in October 2021 after the state auditor issued a demand letter for it, according to the auditor's office. But the auditor's office maintains Favre still owes $228,000 in interest payments.Favre has denied knowing the money he received was welfare money, saying in a statement last year that he was being ""unjustly smeared in the media.""The state of Mississippi is suing Favre and others as part of a massive civil suit seeking to recoup millions in misspent welfare funds. He has not been criminally charged in the case. Favre's suit also alleges that McAfee defamed Favre on his sports podcast, when he called the former quarterback a ""thief"" who was ""stealing from poor people in Mississippi.""CNN has reached out to Sharpe and McAfee for comment.""We take a lot of pride in our work. We had to cover that situation and we certainly said allegedly,"" McAfee said Friday on his podcast. ""And a lot of people are wondering how my lawyers are going to handle this. You know it -- I ain't got 'em. So, let's ride this f**ker. I'm excited to see how it goes. I'll see you in court, pal.""In suing White, the state auditor, Favre's complaint says that White has ""carried out an outrageous media campaign of malicious and false accusations"" against him ""in a brazen attempt to leverage the media attention generated by Favre's celebrity to further his own political career.""""Everything Auditor White has said about this case is true and is backed by years of audit work by the professionals at the Office of the State Auditor. It's mind-boggling that Mr. Favre wants to have a trial about that question,"" White said in a statement.""Mr. Favre has called Auditor White and his team liars despite repaying some of the money our office demanded from him. He's also claimed the auditors are liars despite clear documentary evidence showing he benefited from misspent funds. Instead of paying New York litigators to try this case, he'd be better off fully repaying the amount of welfare funds he owes the state,"" the statement continued."

60,Unexploded artillery shell unearthed at Gettysburg. It may have been a case of friendly fire,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/us/civil-war-shell-gettysburg-pennsylvania/index.html,"Brann usually comes across small stuff like Minié balls, a type of bullet, or percussion caps from firearms. This time, the contract archaeologist got a more powerful reading. Using a pinpoint detector and shovel, Brann gingerly worked from the surface. He kept digging and sifting. Digging and sifting. Twenty inches down.This must be another artillery shell fragment, he figured. Instead, Brann turned up an entire unexploded round, covered in mud and looking as ominous as the day it was fired in July 1863.""He laid it gently on the ground, took a picture of it and ran for the hills,"" said Jason Martz, spokesman for Gettysburg National Military Park.Martz spoke Thursday with Brann about the ""rare find"" of an intact shell near Little Round Top, site of a current overhaul that has closed the landmark to visitors. Only five such shells have been found at Gettysburg since 1980, including one in 1998 near the current visitor center and museum.Park officials quickly closed off roads and called in explosive ordnance experts from the Army's Fort Belvoir, a couple hours away in northern Virginia. That team carried the 10-pound shell away, dug a hole, placed C-4 explosives and blew the artifact up, said Martz.""Safety protocols call for us to assume it is live,"" he said.Many of those following the park's Facebook page debated whether the artillery round, about 7 inches long, should have been saved. ""Ironic that a national military park who wants to preserve the battlefield, would destroy a relic from that very battle. This could have easily been displayed at the park,"" wrote one.But destroying munitions is standard protocol for most government agencies. Rendering them safe for display is a difficult and often dangerous task.Decisions are ""1,000 percent based on safety,"" Martz said in a phone call. And, the spokesman said, the park already has examples of similar artillery rounds in its collection.There's much to learn about the artifact -- for example, where was it fired from and by whom. Thus far, park officials believe a Confederate cannon fired it toward Federal positions and mistakenly dropped shells on friendly Texas regiments trying to navigate the difficult terrain.""It is fascinating to me we can still find items like this in the battlefield,"" retired park historian John Heiser told CNN. ""Nothing surprises me out there. I am sure there is still ordnance buried all over the battlefield.""Gettysburg, a momentous American battleThe Battle of Gettysburg is considered a key turning point in the Civil War. With a Union victory over Gen. Robert E. Lee's troops, ""the loss there dashed the hopes of the Confederate States of America to become an independent nation,"" according to the American Battlefield Trust.Tens of thousands of men were killed or wounded there and features of the battlefield are remembered today: Devil's Den, the Wheatfield, Peach Orchard, Little Round Top and Big Round Top, among others.For many, the most famous landmark is the blood-soaked soil where Pickett's Charge, the doomed Confederate assault on the third day of the July 1-3 battle, took place. A special focus was the so-called Angle, the object of the attack on the Union center.But the 1993 movie ""Gettysburg,"" starring Jeff Daniels as Union hero Joshua Chamberlain, brought a new focus on Little Round Top, said Heiser, the retired Gettysburg park historian.On July 2, Yankee troops on the far left of the line at Little Round Top beat back Rebel soldiers who pushed their way up the hill, intent on rolling up the Union left. But boulders, heavy brush and heavy gunfire ended Confederate dreams that day.After the battle, Union troops recovered artillery shells, and those they did not get were picked over by civilians, with the occasional explosion. While research has just started, park officials believe this one was fired, rather than dropped or left behind. It's possible it spun into soft ground, to be covered by nearly two feet of soil.""It is possible where the shell was found (it) has been undisturbed for nearly 160 years,"" said Martz.Dud could have been a case of friendly firePark officials believe the shell, determined to be a Burton round by members of the Army's 55th Ordnance Company, came from a Parrott cannon or 3-inch ordnance rifle. The park said Federal cannon batteries in the area could not have fired the round. They were firing on other Rebels. Instead, it likely came from ridges or other positions to the west held by Confederates.""It either overshot Devil's Den or undershot Little Round Top,"" said Martz, landing about 50 yards or so from Plum Run, a stream that runs through the battlefield.Members of the attacking 4th and 5th Texas regiments were in the vicinity.""Our artillery on the hill to our rear was cutting its fuse too short. Their shells were bursting behind us, in the treetops, over our heads, and all around us,"" one soldier wrote after the war.""Nothing demoralizes troops quicker than to be fired into by their friends. I saw it occur twice during the war. The first time we ran, but at Gettysburg we couldn't. This mistake was soon corrected and the shells burst high on the mountain or went over it.""Army officials said the round was case shot. Photographs indicate a fuse, meaning it was explosive and needed to be handled carefully after it was found, Heiser said.Despite the destruction of the artifact, park officials say it can still contribute toward visitor education.""We ourselves would like to know as much as we can, so we can tell this story when we are doing ranger programs,"" said Martz. ""It is possible that Confederate artillery fired upon Confederate infantry.""Other artifacts collected by archaeologists as part of the Little Round Top rehabilitation project are being cataloged, placed in plastic bags and then in park storage. Some may one day be put on display at the museum or in a virtual presentation, officials said.Chris Gwinn, chief of interpretation at the park, said in an email that the shell will provide validation to accounts of the battle.""More importantly, what it does do, and I think why the public is so fascinated by it, is that it reminds us that it was all real,"" Gwinn said. ""The battle really happened and beneath the veneer of this beautiful national park are the tangible reminders of its ferocity and tragedy. Finds like this help connect people to the past and make it a real, three-dimensional place."""
61,Republican AGs sue ATF over new rule regulating pistol-stabilizing braces,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/atf-pistol-stabilizing-brace-lawsuit/index.html,"The rule, announced earlier this year by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, went into effect on January 31. Gun control proponents have argued that stabilizing braces effectively transform a pistol into a short-barreled rifle, which is heavily regulated under the National Firearms Act. But in the lawsuit filed by 25 Republican state attorneys general, a Second Amendment advocacy coalition and two of its members, and a disabled gun owner who uses the stabilizing braces, the plaintiffs argue the regulations are ""arbitrary and capricious"" and are not covered by the 1934 law or the Gun Control Act of 1968. ""The rule regulates pistols and other firearms equipped with stabilizing braces, even though the text, structure, history, and purpose of the NFA and GCA show that the statute does not regulate such weapons,"" states the lawsuit, which names US Attorney General Merrick Garland, the ATF and its director as defendants. ATF declined to comment on the lawsuit. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on the suit. The coalition of states challenging the rule is led by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who said Thursday during a news conference announcing the suit that the ATF's new rule ""is also another case of a federal agency not staying in its lane and doing the job the Constitution clearly delegates to Congress -- writing laws."" ""Let's call this what it is: An effort to undermine Americans' Second Amendment rights,"" he said. ""This is an egregious final rule turning millions of common firearms accessories into 'short-barreled rifles.' This is a completely nonsensical regulation.""According to the new rule, manufacturers, dealers and individual gun owners have 120 days to register tax-free any existing short-barreled rifles covered by the rule. They can also remove the stabilizing brace or surrender covered short-barreled rifles to the ATF, the agency said.Restrictions on stabilizing braces have been hotly debated after they were proposed by the ATF in 2020, when the bureau suggested a new rule that would regulate pistol braces under the NFA. The 2020 proposal sparked a major backlash from groups such as the National Rifle Association.The regulations challenged on Thursday were given new life in 2021 after pistols with stabilizing braces were used in mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in Dayton, Ohio. At the time, Garland unveiled several proposals aimed at curbing gun violence, including reupping the restriction on pistol braces."

Typically, such interviews are conducted on the Friday before the Super Bowl and are agreed to much further in advance so that logistics can be coordinated.Biden has sat down for at least two interviews this week, one with PBS NewsHour and another with Telemundo, which would make the potential snub all the more notable.Biden has not granted Fox News a single interview during his presidency, despite the network repeatedly asking. That's likely due to how the right-wing channel portrays him and his administration, with extremists such as Tucker Carlson regularly launching vicious attacks on him.If Biden were to do an interview with Fox News ahead of the Super Bowl, it would almost certainly be with Bret Baier, who is a much more respected, traditional news anchor, albeit one that leans conservative.But it's possible that Biden simply doesn't want to give the network any credence.It's not just the right-wing commentators at Fox News whom Biden has taken issue with. The President has even tangled with Fox News' reporters, calling its White House correspondent in January 2022 a ""stupid son of a bitch."" Biden later called Doocy to apologize.A White House spokesperson declined to comment when asked if Biden will sit down with the right-wing network ahead of the big game.The person familiar with the matter said that Fox News engaged in discussions early on in the process with the White House, but the network has not heard back.A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to a request for comment."

Watkins became only the fifth Black woman ever to travel into space and the first to join a space station expedition. She became an official crew member of the orbiting laboratory that has hosted more than 260 people in its nearly 23-year history.As a young girl, Watkins dreamed of traveling to space and even wrote a poem, called ""My Little Astronaut,"" describing that ambition in grade school, her mother told CNN affiliate WESH-TV in Orlando ahead of her daughter's mission. That desire became a reality as result of the zeal she brought to her academic pursuits, Watkins said in a January interview. And Watkins hopes she can instill that enthusiasm for knowledge into young people who aspire to be like her.""One of the most important things to be able to share is just the importance of dreaming big,"" Watkins said, ""and really being able to find your path — find something that you're passionate about."" She previously described her love of geology, noting it allows her to function ""as a detective.""""You're looking at different puzzle pieces, you know, (in) all kinds (of) different places,"" Watkins said in a NASA video. ""And you're trying to bring those puzzle pieces together to get a full story, a full history of what has happened in a particular place.""Diverse representation remains an issue in the space program, but opportunities for women and people of color are growing. Watkins' astronaut class, selected by NASA in 2017, is one of the most diverse in the space agency's history, and she hopes she can leave the door open for others.""I see places where I wish there was more representation, but I definitely felt the impact of the representation that did exist,"" Watkins said. It was valuable ""to see people who looked like me who had backgrounds and experiences like me, in the roles that I aspired to, and contributing in the ways that I aspired to contribute.""She counts astronaut Mae Jemison, the first Black woman to travel into space, as a key figure, and she drew inspiration from her parents and family members as well as teachers and mentors she met along the way.""It will definitely be a priority for me,"" she said, ""to be able to kind of reach out and connect with the community that I hoped to do a good job of representing."" Journey to spaceWatkins grew up in Lafayette, Colorado, and received her undergraduate degree from Stanford University. Initially, she studied mechanical engineering, hoping it would help her pursue her astronaut dreams.But that ""was just not my passion,"" she said in a NASA broadcast from space. ""It was just not something that got me out of bed every morning.""But flipping through Stanford's course catalog, she discovered geology classes about searching for habitable planets that sparked her interest.""Particularly the idea of planetary geology, the idea of being able to study rocks on the surface of another planet,"" she said, ""just absolutely enamored me and still does to this day.""At Stanford, Watkins became a standout rugby star. As a sophomore, she scored the winning goal in Stanford's 2008 national title game. As a result, her grandmother told CNN affiliate WESH she initially thought Watkins' destiny was to be one of game's best players.On reflection, Watkins said, immersing herself in the dynamics of a team sport as well as her studies prepared her for the grueling requirements of spaceflight.""The international cooperation that is required to do what we do up here every day is exactly like that,"" she said. Watkins spent two years in basic astronaut training and another two years preparing for her space station journey. Boarding the SpaceX rocket, which carried her and three crewmates into orbit, for the first time was a pinch-me moment. But the months of dedicated practice made it also seem routine.""It is this kind of exciting combination of emotions, as you're sitting there on the rocket getting ready to launch,"" Watkins told CNN. ""But really, the launch itself is just amazing. And by the time the launch itself is actually occurring, you're fully focused on the operational side of things.""While in orbitThroughout their time on the space station, Watkins and her crewmates worked closely with Russian cosmonauts, a task with increased geopolitical significance as the war in Ukraine strained relations between the United States and Russia.""We are able to have dinner together, spend time together with them, and we really become family with them,"" Watkins told CNN. ""We all are there to successfully and safely execute our missions. ... We really have that common ground.""Watkins had her hands in hundreds of research projects on the space station, including a botany investigation focused on growing new crops in space. Food being an ever-important topic for astronauts, Watkins also became known during her stay for inventing a hamburger taco topped with macaroni and cheese — dubbed the ""Wattyburger.""Among the surprising experiences in space, Watkins found the microgravity environment was extending to her dreams within a few weeks of her stay on the station.""They were not about being in space, but they took place in space,"" she said. ""You know how dreams are — you kind of remember, 'Oh, yeah, we were definitely floating, so we must have been in space. But since being back here on Earth, I don't think that I have dreamed about being in space. So I guess my brain and body have figured it out.""To pass the time when research projects or routine maintenance weren't overwhelming her calendar, Watkins said she stared out the space station's nook of windows, called the cupola, to catch views of Earth whisking by.""Certainly for me, as a scientist and as a geologist in particular, being able to look out the window and see places that are of geologic interest — even field sites that I had visited or done research previously — to be able to see them from that perspective, from a planetary perspective, was really quite amazing.""On weekends, Watkins said the crew would use a projector to screen movies. Her favorite — and perhaps the most relevant — was the 2015 Matt Damon film, ""The Martian,"" she said. Watkins' doctoral dissertation at UCLA focused on the Martian terrain, analyzing puzzling landslides seen on the planet's surface and how water may have contributed to them.""I thought they did a great job (in the movie),"" she said, ""with the rocks in particular.""What the future holdsWatkins' unbridled love of geology extends to her ambitions within NASA's astronaut corps. Asked what her dream mission would be, Watkins told CNN she wants to travel to Mars and study some of the landmarks she's only been able to analyze through data collected by satellites and Martian rovers.""To go to those areas that we have studied — and that I, in particular, have studied — and be able to get boots on the ground there and compare that kind of field geology with (remotely collected) data ... will be pretty amazing,"" she said.Such a feat is not out of the realm of possibilities for Watkins. As a member of NASA's Artemis team, she's part of a group of astronauts who could be selected to join upcoming crewed missions to the moon, and, perhaps, eventually to Mars.The Artemis program is still in its infancy, but NASA soon is expected to select crew members for an upcoming journey around the moon. Watkins hasn't lobbied NASA for a spot on that mission or any other specific assignments. ""It doesn't work that way,"" she noted.But the Artemis program is offering her and her colleagues an exciting future — one that promises to be filled with people who better represent the general public.""We are an amazing, diverse (astronaut) corps right now,"" Watkins said. ""And so whoever ends up being the faces of (the Artemis II) mission, we are all just excited to really be a part of it and to contribute in the ways that we can all contribute."""

67,Russia to cut oil output by 5% as sanctions bite,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/energy/russia-oil-output-cut/index.html,"""We will not sell oil to those who directly or indirectly adhere to the principles of the price ceiling,"" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement. ""In relation to this, Russia will voluntarily reduce production by 500,000 barrels per day in March. This will contribute to the restoration of market relations.""The cut is equivalent to about 5% of Russian oil output.Futures prices for Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 1.7% Friday to $86 a barrel as traders anticipated a tightening in global supply. US oil also gained 1.7% to trade at $79 a barrel. In June last year, the European Union agreed to phase out all seaborne imports of Russian crude oil within the following six months as part of unprecedented Western sanctions aimed at reducing Moscow's ability to fund its war in Ukraine. The drop in the supply of Russian oil will mean more competition for barrels from other sources, such as the Middle East, that Europe, the United Kingdom and other Western countries now need. In a move aimed at further tightening the screws, G7 countries and the European Union agreed in December to cap the price at which Western brokers, insurers and shippers can trade Russia's seaborne oil for markets elsewhere at $60 a barrel. Earlier this month, EU countries also banned imports of Russia's diesel and refined oil imports. Higher global demand?Novak warned that the crude oil price cap could lead to ""a decrease in investment in the oil sector and, accordingly, an oil shortage.""Neil Crosby, a senior analyst at oil data firm OilX, told CNN that a 500,000 barrel-a-day cut is not the ""worst-case scenario"" and is still a smaller hit to Russian production than most analysts were expecting last year. ""But it sets a precedent for further cuts ahead if necessary or desired by Russian authorities,"" Crosby said, adding that Moscow could be anticipating difficulty in finding enough demand for its crude. Russian Urals crude traded at a discount to Brent crude of $28 a barrel on Friday. Over the past few months, India and China have snapped up cheap oil from Moscow, just as the EU — once Russia's biggest customer for crude — has ended all imports. ""Russia currently has a limited pool of buyers for its crudes and has likely found a ceiling to its export sales in the near term, primarily to China and India,"" said Alan Gelder, vice president of refining, chemicals and oil markets at Wood Mackenzie. According to Reuters, Russia took the decision to reduce its output without consulting the OPEC+ group of producers, which includes Saudi Arabia. OPEC+ decided in October to cut output by 2 million barrels per day and has not adjusted that stance since. The reduction in global oil supply will come at a tricky time. China's swift reopening of its economy in December after almost three years of strict coronavirus restrictions has pushed up estimates for global oil demand. Last month, the International Energy Agency said it expected global demand to surge by 1.9 million barrels per day to reach an all-time high of 101.7 million barrels per day, with China accounting for nearly half of the increase. Western sanctions — added to the grinding cost of war — are weighing on Russia's economy. The country's budget deficit ballooned to $45 billion last year, or 2.3% of its gross domestic product.But Russia's central bank held its main interest rate at 7.5% Friday, saying that economic activity was better than expected and that inflation was likely to come down this year.

68,Opinion: The hidden pleasure in 'The Last of Us',https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/opinions/the-last-of-us-queer-love-representation-hope-ctrp/index.html,"I'm a lesbian, so it's not every day I'm compelled to celebrate two middle-aged, burly, hairy men. I first took note of ""The Last of Us,"" the post-apocalyptic HBO show based on the same-named PlayStation video game, when my queer social feeds lit up about a surprise episode in which a gay couple figured prominently. (CNN shares a parent company with HBO.) There was nothing in the description of the game or the show --  a ""ravaged civilization, where infected and hardened survivors run rampant"" -- that sounded appealing to me. Still, as a professional consumer of LGBTQ media, it felt like required watching.I suffered through the first two nail-biting, but sorely shallow episodes filled with gore and guns and no humanity. Then, in the third episode, the sun came out. As many of you likely already know, Bill, played by Nick Offerman, is a self-described survivalist who manages to escape the mandatory evacuations of his town, hunkering down for a solitary life that feels more normal -- one of fine wine and backup generators -- while the rest of the world devolves into fungal zombies or refugees living under totalitarian, militaristic rule. Then he meets Frank, played by Murray Bartlett, who literally falls into Bill's trap, a hole dug around the property's perimeter to keep everyone -- and everything -- out. The two fall in love and a decade-and-a-half romance ensues, the only on-screen civility to be seen in an otherwise vagrant and collapsed society. Their story and the episode end when Frank chooses to swallow a crushed bottle of pills in his Beaujolais rather than succumb to a degenerative illness. In a true ""Romeo and Juliet"" ending, Bill takes his own life as well, claiming that Frank was his purpose, and he is ""satisfied."" Keep the tissue box handy. It's easy to gloss over how groundbreaking ""The Last of Us"" is in its centering of queer love in such wildly mainstream programming. The on-screen romance not only features two men, but two men not in the flush of youth. I never would have guessed I'd see such a couple celebrated outside of Provincetown Bear Week. Their love affair played out on screen in ways frankly more tender than any heterosexual romance could have been.What's more, instead of being -- as in many other narratives -- the focus (or target) of the story's pain, this gay couple's plotline represents the show's only joyful reprieve in an otherwise doomed world. This is unfolding alongside the increasingly mainstream treatment of queer lives and experiences. Brilliantly, we're also seeing the mainstreaming of non-LGBTQ-identifying actors playing LGBTQ characters -- something that even a decade ago seemed hard to imagine. It's the type of depiction that can help move the needle on acceptance of LGBTQ people, and it comes at an urgent time for equality.We know that visibility increases acceptance of our lives and equal rights. Marriage equality passed, many posited, because an increasing number of people knew someone who was LGBTQ, a fact affirmed by a 2009 Gallup poll. If you accept that somewhere between  5-10% of people are LGBTQ (the latest estimate puts us at 7.1%, according to a 2022 Gallup poll, but given how many people may not feel comfortable sharing, fair to say the number is higher), then it should be no big deal to see LGBTQ people in TV shows and movies. It's only shocking to see us represented because for so long, we weren't.  There have been so many critical moments throughout history that would have benefited from the kind of care taken with the third episode of ""The Last of Us"" -- or shows like ""Heartstopper"" or the remake of ""She-Ra"" or ""Our Flag Means Death."" At earlier times in history, more of this could maybe have helped save lives -- during the Lavender Scare, after the assassination of Harvey Milk, at the height of the AIDS crisis, during the era of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" and the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act and state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions. Too often, even in the recent past, when we did show up on screen played by A-list actors with mainstream budgets, we were the abused -- like Hilary Swank in ""Boys Don't Cry"" -- or disease-ravaged, like Jared Leto in ""Dallas Buyer's Club."" Or we were shriveled inside ourselves unable to break free like Jake Gyllenhaal in ""Brokeback Mountain;"" or else an exponential iteration of every gay stereotype, as in Nathan Lane and Robin Williams in ""The Birdcage."" I don't recall seeing an LGBTQ character in a TV show when I was coming of age in the late 1990s -- outside of the occasional transgender murder victim on an episode of ""Law and Order"" or Ellen DeGeneres getting canceled when she did finally come out. None of this makes ""The Last of Us"" my favorite show -- I'm not converting to apocalyptic horror stories any time soon. But I relish my choice to watch it, primarily because it would be true fiction if the display of affection between two men were met with just fanfare of those who love the show, particularly in this hotbed of sociopolitical warfare we're wading through. The mismatch between the love for ""The Last of Us"" and red state reality is real. There is a noxious faction of homophobic trolls who have been weighing down online ratings on the show with claims that the ""woke"" HBO tried to trick straight people into watching gay people. It makes me wonder if all this time, all those heteronormative directors and screenwriters were trying to trick us queers into watching straight people. The nerve!  Watching ""The Last of Us"" alongside millions of others felt like we had finally been let into the real party. Or perhaps more accurately, like everyone else had finally been let in to our big, queer party and allowed to get a glimpse, however fleeting, of the ways in which our love can be every bit as delicate and beautiful -- and as important -- as theirs. Maybe even more so. After all, what straight man serenades his wife with the right wine pairing, impeccably roasted root vegetables and rabbit followed by a Linda Ronstadt piano performance?"

70,Online sports betting is surging. So is gambling addiction,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/online-sports-gambling-addiction/index.html,"In 2018, the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on commercial sports betting in most of the country. Thirty-three states have made sports gambling legal in the wake of the decision. Now, on Super Bowl Sunday, a record 50.4 million US adults are expected to bet on the game. The booming sports betting industry, lawmakers and even the professional sports leagues themselves are making it easier, faster and more tempting for people to bet on games — and develop gambling problems, say gambling researchers and addiction specialists.A flood of advertising, technology that allows for one-click betting at home, and nearly unlimited betting options during games have collided. There's been a spike in inquiries to state gambling-addiction hotlines, states say.In the past five years, there has been an explosion of online sports betting apps from companies like DraftKings, FanDuel and Caesars. These apps are often replacing illegal betting venues. At the same time, they also attract an influx of new gamblers who had never set foot in a casino or would have known how to place a bet with a bookie.During the Super Bowl, there will be an onslaught of advertisements — most starring celebrity sponsors and athletes — meant to encourage new sign-ups and grab market share. DraftKings will air a commercial featuring Kevin Hart and David Ortiz, while Rob Gronkowski will attempt a field goal kick live in a FanDuel ad. (Any customer who places a Super Bowl bet of five dollars or more on FanDuel will win a share of $10 million in ""free bets"" if Gronkowski makes it.)  Sports teams and leagues were once fiercely opposed to gambling on the games. Now, they've partnered with sportsbooks.  These days, gamblers can also do much more than wager on the outcome of a game. There are options to bet in-game on every quarter, player, and event.Resources for gambling addiction programs have long been thin in the United States and have been stretched further by the current wave of sports betting. In 2020, there were 5.7 million Americans with a gambling disorder, according to a nationwide survey by the National Association of Administrators for Disordered Gambling Services.Focus on gambling disorders has historically been minimal in the United States, said Timothy Fong, a psychiatrist and the co-director of the UCLA Gambling Studies Program.This is in part because people with gambling disorders have been viewed as foolish or lacking willpower, he said. ""We equate the ability to hold onto money and win money with success and equate losing with greed.""There is also sparse federal oversight of the gambling industry, and there are currently no federal funds designated for problem gambling treatment or research, unlike federal funding for alcohol, tobacco and drug addiction programs. A patchwork of state legislation, lack of robust consumer protections in many states, and limited advertising restrictions are adding to the problems.""Many states naively or some other way went about legalizing sports betting without adequately estimating the costs on problem gambling resources,"" said John Holden, an associate professor of management at Oklahoma State University who studies sports gambling regulation. ""There is more that state lawmakers can do within the confines of commercial speech restrictions,"" including authorizing extra funding to go after false and misleading advertising, Holden said.In-game bettingBetting on sports can be a way for some people to develop, maintain or accelerate gambling disorders.There are several features of sports betting that make it different from other forms of gambling and can lead to addictive behavior.Many sports bettors tend to perceive their wages on games are safer and more informed by their own expertise and skills than luck, researchers say. This may give them a false illusion of control.Additionally, live betting within games reduces the delay between risk and reward, and it's increasing the speed and frequency of wagers, experts say.""I got caught up in a lot of the live betting,"" said one 24-year-old man with a gambling disorder who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. He started betting on sports seven years ago through a bookie, but upped his wagers once he started using apps.During football games, he would bet on the outcome of drives and which team would score the next touchdown. As he lost more during a game, he would try again to to win it back on the next play.""You see the way the game is going and you think you know,"" he said. ""It's not like back in the day with a bookie betting on who wins."" He said he lost $100,000 on sports gambling, including money from student loans. He's currently in recovery at Beit T'Shuvah, in Los Angeles, which provides inpatient and outpatient services for people struggling with gambling disorders.Casey Clark, the senior vice president at the American Gaming Association, a trade group for the gambling industry, said that the legalization of sports betting has moved the black market of sports gambling into regulated marketplaces, benefiting states.The gambling industry and sports betting operators work with regulators, professional sports leagues, media companies and advocates to set standards, provide gambling education for consumers and fund recovery efforts for people seeking treatment, Clark said.""We've had a really fast escalation and movement towards giving American consumers access to the legal market that they clearly want. And so we have to continue to evolve that marketplace,"" he said.Struggling to keep upAdvocates for people with gambling disorders say demand for help and treatment services has grown alongside the rapid expansion of legalized sports betting.Inquires to the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey's help hotline about sports gambling have increased 60% since it became legal in the state in 2018, said Felicia Grondin, the organization's executive director.Grondin feels helpless against the constant barrage of advertising encouraging betting on games.""We consider it to be predatory advertising because it's incessant and it glamorizes gambling,"" she said.Clark from the American Gaming Association said the group has created a responsible marketing code to set industry-wide advertising standards.But self-enforcement by the industry cannot make up for robust oversight from regulators, said Keith Whyte, the executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling.""Self-regulation tends to dumb itself down to the lowest common denominator, not the highest,"" he said. ""Some operators are definitely taking advantage of weak regulatory environments in some states.""Free betsEvery state where gambling is legal has a regulatory body that oversees it. But few have ""really done more than the minimal amount to increase funding of problem gambling treatment,"" said Holden. The sports gambling industry is most similar to financial markets, he said, but financial markets are much more regulated than banks.Most states require that sports betting ads disclose the minimum legal age to gamble and responsible gambling messages, such as problem gambling hotlines. Those messages are brief and usually run at the very end. Regulators are wary of how tightly they can curtail messages in gambling advertising without running afoul of First Amendment protections on commercial speech.""A lot of state regulators have big First Amendment fears,"" Holden said. ""No one wants to fund litigation or lose a Supreme Court case over gambling."" In most states, the legal age for sports betting is 21 years old. But ads during games, in stadiums, and with star athlete sponsors normalizes sports betting for kids and teenagers, critics say. The United Kingdom last year banned top athletes and celebrities from appearing in ads endorsing or promoting gambling to try to curb underage gambling. That's unlikely to happen in the United States.Additionally, researchers are troubled by the incentives and promotions some sports betting apps often provide to users, such as sign-up and referral bonuses, promo codes and bonus bets. One 2017 study of people with gambling addictions found that messages with an offer of risk-free kind of bonuses had a high impact. The Ohio Casino Control Commission in January fined DraftKings, Caesars and BetMGM $150,000 each for advertising promotions or bonuses as ""free"" or ""risk-free"" when, in fact, users were required to lose money or risk their own money to obtain the promotion. ""I got more incentive to gamble with these apps that give you free play and match your deposit,"" said the former sports bettor in Los Angeles currently in recovery. He enlisted friends to sign up to get referral fees, and looked at these enticements as free money. ""I'd have to be an idiot to pass this up."""
71,Hyundai starts EV subscriptions for those only need a car sometimes,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/hyundai-car-subscription/index.html,"Customers can reserve a Hyundai Ioniq 5 EV for $899 a month using a smartphone app, or a Kona Electric for $699, a price that includes insurance, maintenance, and 1,000 miles of driving. It's different from leasing because, in addition to the fact that leases don't usually include insurance or maintenance in the monthly fee, Hyundai's subscription plan is open-ended. Drivers can stop the monthly payments and give the vehicle back at any time.Car subscriptions are not a new idea. General Motors experimented with a subscription service like this back in 2017. Using ""Book by Cadillac,"" people could subscribe to Cadillac vehicles and even switch between, say, a Cadillac sedan and an SUV whenever they wanted, for $1,500 a month. As with Hyundai's Evolve+, Cadillac's monthly price also included insurance and maintenance. The experiment lasted less than two years, though, before GM suspended it.Other companies have taken on the idea, though. Volvo offers its Care by Volvo program in all but a few US states. Users can cancel or change vehicles after five months, with prices starting around $900 a month. Porsche also has a car subscription program available in 14 cities, according to Porsche's web site. Participants can either choose a single Porsche model for a monthly fee ranging from $1,700 month to $3,200, or have access to a fleet of different Porsche models for $3,600 a month. Free2Move, a subsidiary of Stellantis, the company that owns the Dodge, Jeep and Fiat brands, also has a car subscription service currently offering access to Jeep and (surprisingly) Tesla models in seven cities.There are also independent car subscription services run by startups such as Finn, and car rental companies like Sixt which offer access to a variety of vehicles from different of brands.Hyundai's program is unique in that it only includes electric vehicles. One of the goals, according to Hyundai, is to act as a sort of test for those who may be curious about electric vehicles. However, the Hyundai Evolve+ program doesn't include any support for charging such as help installing a home charger or included access to public chargers. Usually, people who own an electric vehicle will charge it at home.""We're currently exploring ways to include the charging with the subscription,"" Hyundai spokesman Miles Johnson said in an email.Hyundai's Evolve+ is available through eight dealership locations in six states.Cox Automotive, the company that owns Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, used to also offer car subscription services. That stopped as ""macroeconomic factors,"" including production problems that reduced vehicle inventories, made it difficult, spokesman Mark Schirmer said.""An alternative to traditional vehicle ownership, subscription may offer some consumers more simplicity, variety and flexibility in their transportation choices,"" he said. ""It also could be a way to help drive the adoption of electric vehicles, providing EV intenders a platform to test electric vehicles without the long-term commitment."""

73,Patrick Mahomes: The promising baseball pitcher who became the face of the NFL,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/sport/patrick-mahomes-profile-nfl-super-bowl-spt-intl/index.html,"Instead, it was baseball, the sport his father played professionally for 11 years, that was his first love. Unsurprisingly, he was pretty good at it. Old video footage shows a young Mahomes running around stadiums with a baseball glued to his hand, dressed head-to-toe in whichever team's gear his dad was playing for at the time -- from the Boston Red Sox to the New York Mets. That rare access to the world of elite sport was the foundation for Mahomes to develop into a phenomenal athlete and the 'Showtime' superstar he is today. It was also on the diamond where he started developing his trademark monstrous right arm. Sporting beginningsThings started to get serious for Mahomes when he started high school with scouts paying attention to his sporting prowess -- whether that be in baseball or football.Ironically, it was baseball that always seemed to take center stage. In 2014, while playing for Whitehouse High School, Mahomes showed his big league potential as a pitcher, striking out 16 in a no-hitter and generating reported speeds of 93mph, according to ESPN.The path appeared set: Mahomes would continue the family tradition and follow his namesake into the MLB.""I just remember him being so excited to go to the yard every day,"" Mahomes Sr. told the New York Post, speaking about how he'd take his son to practice. ""I'd have to hold him back just so I could get in the car before we left because he was ready to get out there. ""And he'd get there to the clubhouse, get his uniform on, and he'd be one of the first guys out on the field, and of course, I had to play catch and all that.""But Mahomes' story took a new direction during his college career. Mahomes turned down an offer from the Detroit Tigers who had selected the youngster in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB First-Year Player Draft, opting instead to join Texas Tech University. It was there that the promising pitcher really started to morph into the formidable quarterback he is today. Alongside his football commitments, Mahomes still found time for baseball. He even made one freshman appearance as a pitcher for the college team -- albeit not a great one. According to ESPN, Mahomes threw 15 pitches before being taken off in the game. Safe to say that it's not one of his finest sporting achievements. ""I came into the game, I walked the first guy, I believe,"" Mahomes told reporters in the build up to Super Bowl LVII.""I hit the second guy, gave him a double and they scored a run and then I got taken out of the game.""I think I have an infinity ERA, which isn't probably a good one. That's not something I'm not very proud to have on my record.""Thankfully for football fans, Mahomes' baseball career never took off and it stopped entirely once he started getting serious about reaching the NFL. Mahomes' went 13-19 while playing for the Red Raiders and broke records during his time at Texas Tech -- as a junior, he had four games with at least 500 passing yards.In his final game, he threw for 586 yards, six touchdowns and no interceptions against Baylor serving as a springboard to future success.After showing his worth at the collegiate level, Mahomes was drafted by the Chiefs in 2017. At the time, many franchises balked at picking the unorthodox quarterback, deeming him to be somewhat of a risk. Turns out, it was a risk worth taking. Gamble which paid offSince being drafted, Mahomes has been named the league's Most Valuable Player twice, won the Super Bowl and claimed the Super Bowl MVP trophy, as well as helping to transform the Chiefs into one of the league's premier offensive juggernauts.Now the face of the NFL, he's on the verge of lifting the Lombardi Trophy again, with the Philadelphia Eagles standing in his way on February 12. While Mahomes knows the elation of winning the Super Bowl, he also knows the crushing feeling that comes with falling at the final hurdle. He was outperformed by Tom Brady in 2021 as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers brushed aside the Chiefs at Super Bowl LV. ""This is the worst I've been beaten in a long time,"" he told reporters after the game, before reverting back to those lessons learned during his childhood. ""My dad lost in the World Series and still continued to battle and be himself. Obviously, it hurts right now, but we will get better. We can't let this define us."" His reaction to the defeat is another example of Mahomes' elite attitude. Throughout his career, it's an attribute that's been as dangerous to his opponents as his right arm. After the defeat in 2021, Mahomes doubled-down and finished the current season as the league's leader in passing yards (5,250) and touchdown throws (41). It seems like nothing can get in the way of Mahomes winning a second Super Bowl ring, not least his own body. He once again showed his heart by playing through an ankle injury to lead his team to victories against the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Cincinnati Bengals in order to get to the final.While he's unlikely to be fully healthy for the Super Bowl, it would take a brave person not to play him on the biggest stage of all. After all, Mahomes has a wealth of experience that he's been desperate to share with his teammates. ""Just trying to give them a blueprint of how the week goes. Obviously, you can see it on the schedule, but I want them to see it from a player's perspective,"" Mahomes, mature beyond his years, told reporters ahead of the big game.""The Super Bowl week is special, it's a special week, but it's not about being down there for the week of the Super Bowl, it's about winning the game. I want guys to keep that at the front of their mind.""Enjoy the whole entire week but make sure you're prepared to go out there and play your best football as well.""It's been quite the ride for that young boy from Texas who was chasing his father around the baseball diamond. Now, all those years later, the roles have reversed.""My baby boy did what he always do,"" Mahomes Sr. said from the field after watching his son lead the Chiefs to this year's Super Bowl. ""You know he's gonna show up and show out, and I'm just glad he did it.""  "
74,DHS hires private law firm to defend against possible impeachment of Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/mayorkas-impeachment-law-firm/index.html,"House Republicans have been moving to build a case against Mayorkas as they consider launching rare impeachment proceedings against a Cabinet secretary.""The Department of Homeland Security has retained outside counsel to help ensure the Department's vital mission is not interrupted by the unprecedented, unjustified, and partisan impeachment efforts by some Members of Congress, who have already taken steps to initiate proceedings,"" a Homeland Security spokesperson said.""DHS will continue prioritizing its work to protect our country from terrorism, respond to natural disasters, and secure our borders while responding appropriately to the over 70 Congressional committees and subcommittees that have oversight of DHS,"" the spokesperson said.The law firm is Debevoise & Plimpton, according to one source. While the Department of Homeland Security Office of General Counsel has various lawyers to deal with matters, including immigration and cybersecurity, the outside firm is being brought in on a government contract and only be utilized to the extent it is needed throughout the process, another source said.Debevoise & Plimpton declined to comment.It's exceedingly rare for a Cabinet secretary to be impeached, something that has only happened once in US history -- when William Belknap, the secretary of war, was impeached by the House before being acquitted by the Senate in 1876.Republican lawmakers have argued that Mayorkas' claims of having operational control of the border are unfounded and that the record arrests mark a dereliction of duty -- two themes that have come up repeatedly in congressional hearings and have been cited as reason to impeach the DHS secretary. Over recent weeks, key committee chairman already held two congressional hearings over the Biden administration's handling of the US-Mexico border. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee, which would have jurisdiction over an impeachment resolution, held its first border-related hearing.""These numbers make clear that the Biden administration does not have operational control of the border,"" House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan said during a February hearing. ""Month after month after month, we have set records for migrants coming into the country and frankly, I think it's intentional.""Mayorkas has previously said his department will cooperate with committees that are conducting oversight. Asked by reporters whether launching impeachment proceedings against the secretary was personal, Mayorkas said: ""If somebody else was in this position do you think that vitriol would be less? I don't take it personally. I take my work personally."" The Biden administration faces unprecedented movement across the Western hemisphere that has contributed to a surge of migrants at the border, including more people from different countries, such as Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. The US is largely barred from deporting migrants to Cuba and Venezuela, presenting a unique set of challenges for DHS.US border authorities encountered migrants more than 2.3 million times along the US-Mexico border in fiscal year 2022, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. Of those, more than 1 million migrants were turned away at the border.In early January, the Biden administration expanded a humanitarian parole program to include Haitians, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans and Cubans to provide a legal pathway for them to enter the US instead of crossing the border. The administration also made those nationalities eligible for Title 42, meaning they can now be turned away by authorities if they don't apply for the program.Since then, there has been a significant decline in migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela crossing the US-Mexico border unlawfully, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which attributed the drop to new border measures.This story has been updated with additional details."

Canada, the reigning women's soccer Olympic champion, is scheduled to face the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) on February 16 in its first match of the SheBelieves Cup. ""To be clear,"" Sinclair tweeted. ""We are being forced back to work for the short term. This is not over. We will continue to fight for everything we deserve and we will win. The She Believes is being played in protest."" Representatives from the Players' Association met with Canada Soccer for a meeting on Saturday, both parties said. Canada Soccer added that it has committed to negotiating a comprehensive collective agreement with both the Women's and Men's National Teams which ""will be an historic deal that will deliver real change and pay equity."" The players said in a February 10 statement that they had been negotiating with Canada Soccer for more than a year and are now ""being told to prepare to perform at a world-class level without the same level of support that was received by the Men's National Team in 2022."" Training camps have been cut for the women's team, as well as the number of players and staff invited and the already limited youth program, the players' statement said.

77,Minnesota biologists rescue trapped black bear,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/us/minnesota-bear-rescue-ditch-trnd/index.html,"The bear had hunkered down in a culvert alongside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department.But when the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, according to the department.Staff from the department quickly responded to the scene and helped remove the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, ""examined the bear and pronounced him healthy but groggy -- obviously, because he'd been woken up from his winter sleep,"" according to the Facebook post.The department then relocated the bear to a state sanctuary to resume his hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.The department reminded residents that moving bears is a job best left to the professionals. If you're worried about a bear in your neighborhood, you should contact local authorities -- not try to move or feed the sleeping giant. In this case, bystanders first tried to dig out the bear by themselves and offered him food, including Pop-Tarts, lettuce and Fancy Feast cat food. But, luckily for the well-intentioned diggers, ""because bears don't have the desire to eat in the winter, the bear didn't bite.""Minnesota is home to between 12,000 and 15,000 black bears, found mainly in the northern third of the state, according to the Department of Natural Resources. The predators hibernate for as long as six or seven months in the winter, during which time they do not eat and live off of their stored body fat."
78,"Eat less to live longer, study says, but are the tools measuring longevity accurate?",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/health/restricting-calories-longevity-wellness/index.html,"""We've known for nearly 100 years that calorie restriction can extend healthy life span in a variety of laboratory animals,"" said senior author Daniel Belsky, an associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. ""It does this by changing biology in ways consistent with a slowing of the process of aging, although the specific mechanisms of how this occurs are still under investigation,"" said Belsky, who studies longevity. ""We decided to drill down to the cellular level in people to see if the same is true.""The study used what are commonly known as ""biological clocks"" to determine the pace of aging in its participants. Bioclocks are designed to measure how old people are biologically compared with their real ages chronologically.""Our study found evidence that calorie restriction slowed the pace of aging in humans,"" said colead author Calen Ryan, an associate research scientist at the Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center at Columbia.""Our findings are important because they provide evidence from a randomized trial that slowing human aging may be possible,"" Ryan said in a statement.But longevity scientist Dr. Peter Attia dismissed the study results as ""noise."" ""I just don't see any evidence that any of the biologic clocks have meaning,"" Attia, who was not involved in the study, said via email. He hosts ""The Drive,"" a podcast dedicated to explaining and applying longevity research to everyday life.""The only validation that matters — which to my knowledge has not been done, but hopefully will be — is to see if 'biologic age' can predict future life better than chronological age,"" he said.Biological age predictors are controversial, said calorie restriction researcher Pankaj Kapahi, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California. ""At best, they're telling you something about a very small aspect of aging,"" said Kapahi, who was not involved in the study. ""For example, grip strength is also a biological age predictor, how active you are is a predictor, and we all know people who fall apart physically but are cognitively all there, so you also need to test cognitive aging. ""Some researchers are trying to boil it down with bio-aging tests,""  he added. ""This is a much more complex problem, and I think it's an overstatement to say the tests really predict biological age.""The CALERIE studyDecades of research in animals have shown that calorie restriction produces health benefits, even slowing the pace of aging. Would the same be true in people?A study in the 1950s asked people to reduce 50% of their calories, leading to malnutrition or a lack of key micronutrients in participants. Later research often focused on calorie reduction in people whose body mass index would be considered medically obese.The first clinical trial of calorie restriction in people at normal weight (a BMI of about 20 to 25) started in 2007. It was called CALERIE, or the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy. Because of the malnutrition found in the earlier study that cut calories drastically, CALERIE asked 143 adults between the ages of 21 and 50 to cut 25% of the calories they typically ate for a two-year period. Another group of 75 people maintained their normal diets, serving as a control group. During the trial, all manner of tests were done at six-month intervals to gather information on weight loss, change in resting metabolic rate, impact on cognitive function and markers of inflammation, cardiovascular health and insulin sensitivity. The results of CALERIE, published in 2015, found that on average people in the restricted group were able to cut 14% of their calories, or about half of the 25% goal. However, that amount reduced their fat mass by about 10% and decreased their cardiometabolic risk factors with no adverse effects on quality of life, researchers said. There were also reductions in tumor necrosis factor alpha, a protein that promotes insulin resistance and obesity-induced type 2 diabetes.A number of other studies have used blood samples and other data collected on the CALERIE participants to explore other ways modest calorie restriction might benefit the body. For example, Yale University researchers found restricting calories increased the health of the thymus, an organ that produces immune system T cells — one of the body's key warriors against invaders.A difference in findingsThe new study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Aging, culled DNA sequences from white blood cells taken at 12-month intervals from participants in CALERIE. Belsky's team then analyzed methylation marks — signs of epigenetic changes — on the DNA, looking for symptoms of aging.Epigenes are proteins and chemicals that sit like freckles on each gene, waiting to tell the gene ""what to do, where to do it, and when to do it,"" according to the National Human Genome Research Institute.""Increasingly, changes to our cells' epigenomes, the systems that control which genes in the genome are turned on and off, are being recognized as drivers of the aging process,"" said anti-aging expert David Sinclair, a professor of genetics in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School and codirector of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research.""Clocks that measure these changes are proving to be indicators of future health and what interventions might slow and even reverse the aging process,"" said Sinclair, who was not involved in the study.In the new study, researchers used two epigenetic clocks — PhenoAge and GrimAge — and a new tool Belsky recently invented in conjunction with Duke University. This third bioclock, called DunedinPACE, attempts to determine the pace of aging from a single blood test, Belsky said.The PhenoAge and GrimAge bioclocks showed no signs of reduced aging in the blood samples of  participants in CALERIE, said Belsky, who is also a scientist with Columbia's Robert N. Butler Aging Center. However, DunedinPACE, the clock created by Belsky's and Duke's teams, did find a 2% to 3% reduction in the pace of aging,  ""which in other studies translates to a 10-15 percent reduction in mortality risk, an effect similar to a smoking cessation intervention,"" according to a statement from Columbia.Controversy over bioclocksCritics of the study, however, were not impressed. The performance of the DunedinPACE test was ""mediocre at best,"" Attia said, finding only a weak association with biological aging.The fact that the two other bioclocks found no anti-aging benefits was no surprise, said the Buck Institute's Kapahi: ""These biological age predictors don't agree with each other and don't necessarily agree with other biological measures. ""It's going to confuse the public, and unfortunately people are buying these tests when there's very little useful information that comes out of them.""While it's true epigenetic biomarkers are not yet ready to be used in clinical trials, ""many different studies in many different datasets and populations have shown these algorithms are predictive of differences between people in who gets sick and who lives or dies,"" Belsky countered. ""This is not a game over moment. It's more like game on,"" Belsky said. ""What we have now is a proof of concept — a methylation biomarker that shows faster aging in people we know to be at higher risk for disease, disability and death, and slower aging in people who we know to be at lower risk.""Does caloric restriction work?Putting aside the debate over how slower aging is measured, there is a role for caloric restriction in extending life, especially in ""overnourished"" individuals, Attia said. ""I don't want a reader to think this intervention (calorie restriction) is of no value, only that (the study) does not 'prove' a reduction in the pace of aging,"" he said in an email.Time-restricted eating and dietary restriction of certain foods are two additional ways to curb ""overnutrition,"" which Attia believes is the biggest driver of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases.""I am not aware of any evidence that one 'strategy' or method is superior. The best one is the one that works for a person, but calorie restriction certainly works for some, and therefore is clearly beneficial,"" Attia said. ""All of these interventions will lead to a longer and better life, but these aging clocks tell us less than zero about that process.""There are many other ways to curb aging as well, Kapahi said. ""We're trying to learn more about aging and we are, but calorie restriction is just one intervention,"" he said. ""You likely need to do that in combination with exercise, with good sleep, with a positive attitude and good mental health. All these things combined will likely play a much bigger role in slowing aging."" "

""Whether it's direct or indirect, it impacts who we are.""Deadwyler made the remarks after being asked about similar comments made by ""Till"" director Chinonye Chukwu.""We live in a world and work in industries that are so aggressively committed to upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women,"" Chukwu wrote in an Instagram caption on the day the Oscar nominations were announced.Deadwyler wasn't the only Black woman snubbed for a best actress Academy Award nomination. Viola Davis, who starred in ""The Woman King"" and was also considered an Oscars frontrunner, wasn't nominated either.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has long had a diversity problem, and despite a record number of nominations for Asian actors and filmmakers this year, the organization once again came under fire for who it chose to honor and who it didn't.Of the 20 actors up for Oscars this year, two are Black: Angela Bassett, nominated in a supporting role for ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever""; and Brian Tyree Henry, nominated in a supporting role for ""Causeway.""As Deadwyler and Davis were shut out of the best actress category, Andrea Riseborough received a surprise nod for her performance in the indie film ""To Leslie"" -- a decision that caused controversy because of a social media campaign that major Hollywood stars waged on Riseborough's behalf shortly before voting for Oscar nominations began. The campaign, some critics noted, showed just how beneficial it is to have famous White friends.""Whether it be a 'grassroots' campaign spearheaded by peers or multi-million industry dollars backing one, we rarely are the benefactors,"" Davis wrote on Instagram this week. ""If you see my work you also have to see our plight and either contribute to it or hinder it.""There were also no women nominated for the best director Oscar, even though several films helmed by female directors this year were widely lauded by critics.Gina Prince-Bythewood, whose film ""The Woman King"" received a coveted A+ Cinemascore yet did not receive a single Oscar nomination, said she was disappointed by the omission and called this awards season ""an eye-opener.""""But the Academy made a very loud statement, and for me to stay quiet is to accept that statement,"" she wrote in a first-person piece for The Hollywood Reporter. ""So I agreed to speak up, on behalf of Black women whose work has been dismissed in the past, is dismissed now like Alice Diop and Saint Omer, Chinonye Chukwu and Till — and for those who haven't even stepped on a set yet.""CNN has reached out to the Academy for comment."

83,The Super Bowl is almost here. But the NFL has had a rocky season,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/sport/nfl-controversies-hamlin-watson-cec/index.html,"The hype starts early in the season. Talking heads make Super Bowl predictions, the NFL announces the game's halftime show headliner, and excitement builds for months.Sunday's game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs is likely to once again be the most-watched television event of the year. Grammy-winner Chris Stapleton will sing the national anthem, and megastar Rihanna will perform at halftime. ""(Football) has become a national pastime,"" said Jason Reid, senior NFL writer at ESPN's Andscape and author of ""Rise of the Black Quarterback."" But despite the sport's popularity, questions have lingered. For years, the NFL has faced criticism about its core product: that it's too violent, unsafe, and discriminatory against Black players and coaches.A series of events from the last five months has magnified those concerns, intensifying scrutiny on America's most powerful pro sports league. From sexual harassment allegations against star quarterback Deshaun Watson to Tua Tagovailoa's multiple concussions to Damar Hamlin's frightening collapse on the field, this has been a bumpy season for the NFL. Here's a look back at some of the most controversial events of the season -- the ones that might not make a NFL highlight reel. Deshaun Watson gets an 11-game suspension after sexual harassment allegations What happened:More than two dozen women came forward last year alleging sexual misconduct against Deshaun Watson from his time as the quarterback of the Houston Texans. (Last summer, Watson was traded to the Cleveland Browns).Two grand juries separately declined to indict Watson on criminal charges, and 23 of the 24 civil suits filed against him were settled confidentially. In August, Watson received an 11-game suspension and a $5 million fine -- the NFL's harshest punishment for someone accused of sexual assault. Watson apologized in a statement for ""any pain this situation has caused"" but has repeatedly denied the allegations and told the media in August that he plans to ""continue to stand on my innocence."" The quarterback, whose five-year, $230 million deal is the largest guaranteed contract  in NFL history, didn't make his Browns debut until December. Why it matters:The severity of Watson's suspension was notable. But many critics of the league still wondered whether the punishment was enough and if the NFL is truly able to prevent violence against women by its players.  ""Professional football cannot realistically address its violence against women problem with empty claims that it will require players to reflect and improve their behavior, while the players persist in asserting blanket denials of wrongdoing,"" Deborah Epstein, the co-director of the Georgetown University Law Center's Domestic Violence Clinic, told CNN at the time.Tua Tagovailoa's injuries bring more scrutiny to the NFL's concussion protocols What happened:Many expected quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to make the Miami Dolphins playoff contenders. The Dolphins did in fact make the postseason -- but Tagovailoa missed the game with a concussion. It wasn't his first.His health scares started September 25 in a game against the Buffalo Bills, when Tagovailoa stumbled backward and fell during a play, hitting his head on the turf. Though he initially stood up on his own, Tagovailoa then staggered and had to be helped by two teammates. Tagovailoa was taken out of the game, evaluated by doctors, and allowed to return after halftime. Later, both the NFL and the NFL Players Association concluded that concussion protocols were correctly followed.But four days later, in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Tagovailoa was injured again, carted off the field and taken via ambulance to a nearby hospital. This time, he was diagnosed with a concussion. (Days later, the NFLPA fired the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant involved in the decision to let Tagovailoa return in the game against the Bills.) Then, on Christmas against the Green Bay Packers, it happened again. This time, Tagovailoa was not evaluated during the game -- the diagnosis came the next day after he showed concussion-like symptoms. The Dolphins shut Tagovailoa down for the rest of the season. (Two concussions occurring close together can have permanently disabling effects, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons says.) Players sustained 149 concussions in games this season -- an 18% increase over 2021, the NFL said last week. That total also is 14% higher than the three-year average (130) between 2018 and 2020.The league's chief medical officer attributed the rise in part to a protocol change that he said ""broadened and strengthened"" the definition of a concussion following Tagovailoa's injuries earlier in the season.Why it matters:The NFL has long been scrutinized for the impact concussions and brain injuries sustained during games have had on its players. And the league has made strides. Even having concussion protocols is a relatively recent advancement, just implemented in 2013. But Tagovailoa's situation has intensified scrutiny of the league's handling of head injuries, particularly as more is learned about CTE, a condition linked to repeated blows to the head. Earlier this year, the parents of former star wide receiver Demaryius Thomas revealed Thomas had stage 2 CTE when he died in 2022, a year after retiring from football, at age 33. After Tagovailoa's first concussion, NFLPA president JC Tretter said he was ""outraged"" by what happened, saying that the league still has a long way left to go in making the game safe.""Until we have an objective and validated method of diagnosing brain injury, we have to do everything possible, including amending the protocols, to further reduce the potential of human error,"" he wrote, in a statement posted to Twitter. ESPN's Reid says the NFL has made some advancements to mitigate the risk of concussions, like creating safer helmets. But even with precautions, football is inherently violent.""I do think the league is trying to do what it can, within the parameters of still playing the game,"" he said. ""But it's a violent game.""Lovie Smith is fired by Texans, highlighting claims of discrimination against Black coaches What happened:When Lovie Smith was hired as the new head coach of the Houston Texans in February 2022, he became one of two Black head coaches in the NFL, which has 32 teams. ""There's a problem,"" he said at the time.In January, after finishing the season 3-13-1, Smith was fired, becoming the second Black coach in two years to be let go by the franchise. Two weeks later, the Texans hired DeMeco Ryans, who is Black, as his replacement.Ryans joins Todd Bowles (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers), Mike McDaniel (Miami Dolphins), Robert Saleh (New York Jets) and Ron Rivera (Washington Commanders) as the only head coaches of color in the league.Why it matters:People of color make up 70% of NFL players, and the league has faced questions for years regarding the lack of diversity at the head coaching level. For many, Smith's firing was just another example of Black coaches not being given a fair shot by teams. ""The Houston Texans have fired Lovie Smith after 1 year,"" former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III tweeted following the news. ""Using 2 Black Head Coaches to tank and then firing them after 1 year shouldn't sit right with anyone,"" he added, referring also to previous coach David Culley, who was also canned after one season. Those sentiments were echoed by NFL Hall of Famer Michael Irvin. ""It's a mess in Houston, and they bring these guys in and they use them as scapegoats,"" Irvin said on ESPN. ""And this is what African American coaches have been yelling about for a while and it's blatant, right in our face.""Smith's firing, and the hiring of Ryans to replace him, came amid onging pressure on the NFL to hire and retain head coaches of color. Last year, Brian Flores -- currently on the coaching staff of the Pittsburgh Steelers but previously the head coach of the Miami Dolphins -- filed a federal civil lawsuit against the NFL and multiple teams, alleging racial discrimination in the hiring practices for head coaching jobs.  In April, two other coaches -- Steve Wilks, former Arizona Cardinals head coach, and Ray Horton, longtime NFL assistant -- joined Flores' lawsuit, also claiming discrimination. Many people within the NFL understand the need for diversity on teams, Reid says. But the NFL doesn't hire coaches -- team owners do. ""I think the league has been proactive in trying to do what it can to move the ball,"" he said. ""But the league can only do so much.""Damar Hamlin's sudden collapse renews questions about player safety What happened:When Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed mid-game last month against the Cincinnati Bengals, the nation held its collective breath. At the time, many feared Hamlin had died. The Bills later stated his heartbeat was restored on the field by team medical staff before he was taken to a hospital. It was later revealed that Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest. Though he has since been released from the hospital, his representative has said Hamlin still faces a ""lengthy recovery."" Why it matters:Hamlin's injury shocked everyone, including those who don't typically pay attention to football. Even more shocking was reporting by ESPN that the NFL had initially planned to resume the game after Hamlin was carted off the field. The NFL strongly denied that claim, but the episode renewed assertions that the league -- whose players are bigger, stronger and faster than ever -- has simply become too dangerous.""It's like trying to make a safe cigarette,"" ESPN host Bomani Jones told CNN last month after being asked whether football can be made safer. ""It's just not really how this works -- how this game works -- and part of why people watch is the fact that it's not safe.""The NFL is listening. For the first time ever, this year's Pro Bowl -- essentially an all-star game between the best players from the NFC and AFC -- was a flag football game, with no tackling. The change came in part due to feedback from the players, many of whom did not want to risk an injury in an exhibition game.The league has also made efforts to make the game safer through renewed concussion protocols and other safety measures. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said this week that overall player injuries were down nearly 6% this season.And yet, questions remain. Just this week a group of former NFL players sued the league's disability benefit program, Goodell and the disability board, accusing them of routinely denying disability claims. Pro football is a multibillion-dollar industry. It's also just a game. Is it worth the risk to players' health? ""As long as people love it, and they keep spending their money, and the television networks keep giving the NFL these massive contracts, it's not going anywhere,"" Reid said. And so, yes, much of the world will gather around chicken wings and cheese dip to watch the Super Bowl. But beyond Sunday's pageantry, the league's issues will linger."

86,FEC orders Santos to formally declare his 2024 candidacy or 'disavow' post-midterm fundraising,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/fec-george-santos-campaign-fundraising/index.html,"In a letter to Santos, the FEC says he has until March 14 to ""either disavow these (fundraising and spending) activities by notifying the Commission in writing that you are not a candidate, or redesignate your principal campaign committee by filing a Statement of Candidacy.""According to an FEC review of Santos' filings, his campaign committee ""has no debts from the previous election cycle and has accepted contributions and/or made expenditures in support of your 2024 candidacy in excess of $5,000, thus meeting the definition of 'candidate' per Federal Election Campaign Laws.""This new round of scrutiny comes as the embattled freshman is expected to face an investigation by the House Ethics Committee, which could further imperil his chaotic political career. Santos' congressional tenure thus far has been dominated by questions about his repeated fabrications about his background and resume. The FEC letter marks his latest brush with the commission, which has flagged issues with some of his previous campaign finance reports, including questions about loans, expenditures and officials listed on filings.Were Santos to confirm he plans to seek reelection, what has become a headache for national and local Republicans will likely intensify. He has already been disavowed by the Nassau County GOP, which is facing backlash following his election after two years of hard-fought local gains. A handful of Republican members from the state's House delegation have also called on Santos to resign. Back home, the picture is even more bleak, with 78% of voters -- including more than 7 in 10 Republicans -- in his 3rd Congressional District saying he should resign, according to a recent Newsday/Siena College poll.  The FEC requires any individual who has raised or spent more than $5,000 on a campaign for federal office to register as a candidate within 15 days of reaching that mark. Any such candidate, including incumbents like Santos, must file a statement of candidacy with the commission each electoral cycle. Santos' FEC filings show that he's raised and spent tens of thousands of dollars since the midterms, easily triggering the commission's requirement for a statement of candidacy. Most incumbents promptly file statements of candidacy for the following cycle even if they don't intend to run, to avoid running afoul of FEC rules.But the scandal surrounding Santos has added additional weight to the formality.This story has been updated with additional details.

87,'The Last of Us' demonstrates its fearlessness with another shocking episode,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/entertainment/the-last-of-us-episode-5-review/index.html,"Apocalyptic drama inevitably means that a lot of people die, good as well as bad. Yet as is so often true when watching the news, a small-scale tragedy can hit harder than a mass-casualty event, especially when it involves an innocent.After the justifiable hoopla caused by its third episode, HBO's ""The Last of Us"" plucked at the heartstrings again in its fifth hour, subtitled ""Endure and Survive,"" which featured the characters of Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) befriending a pair of brothers, one of whom was deaf.Ellie bonded with the younger one, the eight-year-old Sam (Keivonn Woodard), laughed with him, found a few moments to behave like kids with him. Sam decorated the places he and his brother, Henry (Lamar Johnson), were forced to hide with childlike drawings. It was sweet, a moment of normalcy within a brutal and chaotic world.The flashback made you like these characters and root for them. And then suddenly, abruptly, they killed Sam, after turning him into something inhuman.Before someone references the game on which the series is based, a brief reminder that TV shows and games are different animals. Simply put, killing a child in drama is always dicey, because those moments strike the audience in a unique and unsettling way.The episode speaks to the fearlessness of the storytelling by producers Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, presenting a stark demonstration -- if one was still needed at this point -- that the stakes in the show's world are as stark as they come.The most obvious parallel would be a similar sequence in the second season of ""The Walking Dead,"" another zombie drama, when a missing little girl, Sophia, came shuffling out of the barn having transformed into a glassy-eyed monster.Beyond departing from the comics, that sequence felt genuinely shocking at the time, and reinforced that the show's dramatic ambitions went beyond mere horror. As the website Undeadwalking.com put it, ""This scene made many fans realize this wasn't a typical series. This one wasn't afraid to push things to the max and make the viewers uncomfortable and feel the pain of loss along with the characters.""""The Last of Us"" has demonstrated even more impressive range thus far, in the process establishing a strong showcase for guest stars, including Melanie Lynskey in these latest hours. Yet as Mazin noted in the video that followed the episode, those subplots also inform and impact the relationship between Joel and Ellie, which was evident in their unspoken exchange at the end.The emotional wallop the show has delivered helps explain its popularity and social-media footprint -- inspiring even the skeptical to tune in -- and why the term ""zombie drama,"" while accurate, is too reductive. If the third episode resonated because of its romantic underpinnings, the latest one (dropped early on HBO Max, and available in its regular slot on HBO opposite the Super Bowl) ultimately came around to unimaginable loss, and making viewers acutely feel it.Mission, painfully, accomplished.(Like CNN, HBO is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.)"
88,California state agencies investigating conditions at the two sites of the Half Moon Bay mass killing,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/us/half-moon-bay-mushroom-farm-potential-labor-violations-investigations/index.html,"The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health and the state's Labor Commissioner's Office ""want to ensure that employees are being afforded all the protections of California labor laws,"" a state official told CNN in an emailed statement. The statement did not offer further details about the probe, saying neither agency comments on ongoing investigations. The suspect worked on one of the mushroom farms where he is suspected of fatally shooting four of his coworkers. The site, owned by California Terra Garden, is a mushroom farm where the suspected gunman worked and lived on for at least seven years, according to officials and a spokesperson for that company. A California Terra Garden spokesperson has said there were several mobile homes and trailers for employees on the property. The suspect was also a former employee of another nearby farm where he's accused of killing three former colleagues, San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus previously said.In a news conference the day after the massacre, California Gov. Gavin Newsom highlighted the living conditions the farm workers faced.""Some of you should see where these folks are living, the conditions they're in. Living in shipping containers,"" the governor said. ""Folks getting nine bucks an hour ... no healthcare, no support, no services, but taking care of our health, providing a service to each and every one of us every single day.""And in a statement several days later, the governor's office called the workers' living conditions ""deplorable.""""California is investigating the farms involved in the Half Moon Bay shooting to ensure workers are treated fairly and with the compassion they deserve,"" according to a January 26 statement posted on Twitter by Daniel Villaseñor, the governor's deputy press secretary. At the time, a California Terra Garden spokesperson responded to the accusations, saying the governor's comments did not reflect the living conditions of farm workers. ""The salary of all employees range from $16.50 to $24,"" the spokesperson said, adding that workers receive ""vacation days, company-sponsored health insurance, life/disability insurance, workman's compensation insurance, and access to a 401(k) plan."" CNN has reached out to California Terra Garden for further details on how its employees are paid and for comment on the state agencies' investigations. The spokesperson said last month that the eight families who lived on the property lived in ""mobile homes and large recreational vehicles"" equipped with kitchens, bathrooms, showers and ""standard living amenities.""""No one lives in anything like shipping containers or tents as was erroneously reported. The families pay approximately $300 a month to rent these living spaces, well below market rate,"" the company spokesperson said."
89,"Instant noodles account for almost a third of childhood burn injuries, study says",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/us/instant-noodle-childhood-burn-wellness-trnd/index.html,"The study, published in the journal ""Burns"" by a group of researchers at the university's burn center, examined data regarding all pediatric patients who were admitted with scald injuries caused by hot liquids between 2010 and 2020.Of the 790 total cases of childhood scald injuries, 31% were caused by instant noodles.""Anecdotally, it felt like every other child we were consulted on for a burn was injured by instant noodles, so we wanted to dive into the data to see what the trend really was,"" said senior author Sebastian Vrouwe, assistant professor of surgery at University of Chicago Medicine, in a news release. ""Our hope is to develop the groundwork for future burn prevention programming, as essentially all childhood burns are in some way preventable.""Vrouwe said he and his team did not expect instant noodles to be such a significant cause of childhood burns.""We were surprised by the sheer magnitude of the problem, which confirmed that focused effort and awareness on these types of burns could have a significant impact in the communities that our burn center serves,"" he said in the release.The study also found certain children were more likely to experience burns from instant noodles than others. On average, the patients with instant noodle burns were more likely to be Black and to be from ZIP codes with a lower average childhood opportunity index score.The researchers linked the trend to the fact instant noodles are a low-cost meal option. Because of the link, ""global efforts to address childhood poverty would very likely have positive secondary effects on burn prevention,"" wrote the researchers.Children with burns from instant noodles were also slightly older than children with other burn injuries, with an average age of 5.4 years. The researchers described it as ""the age at which children are able to attempt to prepare instant noodles, but not old enough to do so safely."" The children were also more likely to have been unsupervised at the time of the injury.In the news release, Vrouwe explained adult supervision is an essential preventive measure for reducing burns from instant noodles and other foods.""Direct caregiver supervision is one important step in burn prevention,"" he said. ""The amount of heat contained in these noodles can easily cause second- and third-degree burns in anyone, but young children are particularly vulnerable due to their relatively smaller bodies and thinner skin.""Kyran Quinlan, a pediatrician who has conducted research on childhood burn injuries, told CNN via email it was ""amazing how common this one mechanism of child scald is.""Quinlan, who did not contribute to the study, noted it only included patients admitted to the University of Chicago's Burn Center, which primarily serves a low-income community on the south side of Chicago. So while the findings might not be generalizable to the rest of the country, they do ""tell a story quite common in the inner city areas across the country,"" he said.Like Vrouwe, Quinlan also emphasized the importance of supervising young children using the microwave to prepare instant noodles or other foods.""Young children cannot and should not operate a microwave without supervision,"" he said. He added the study could ""help parents realize that these types of scalds happen all the time.""""Burn units around the country see this exact type of burn mechanism frequently,"" he pointed out.Quinlan has advocated for ""child-resistant"" doors on microwaves, which he said are one measure to prevent burns among young children. The microwaves will be widely available for sale in the US starting in March, he said.""We need to keep learning about what works to protect young children from these severe and often disfiguring scalds,"" he said."
90,"Kaya, a service dog who helped her owner advocate for PTSD treatment and veterans' health, has died",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/us/kaya-ptsd-service-dog-death-trnd/index.html,"The 8-year-old German shepherd was euthanized on February 4 after being diagnosed with cancer, her handler, Cole Lyle, told CNN in an interview.Kaya stood alongside Lyle as he advocated before Congress for better access to service dogs for veterans.Lyle joined the Marine Corps after graduating high school and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011. He told CNN that he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder shortly after returning from deployment. But the treatment methods he was prescribed didn't work for him. And a divorce and joblessness exacerbated his mental health challenges.""I was really at a very low point in my life and almost became a veteran suicide statistic,"" he said.But inspired by a friend who had a service dog, he sought out one of his own and adopted Kaya in Dallas, Texas. Lyle explained that Kaya was specifically trained to help with his PTSD symptoms, such as waking him up from nightmares or licking his face when he was having an anxiety attack. The interventions ""help you calm down and kind of breaks the snowball effect of that anger, depression, sadness, whatever it is,"" he said. At the time, he said, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs didn't provide funding for PTSD service dogs -- so he spent $10,000 of his own money adopting and training Kaya. He explained that although there are non-profits that provide veterans with service dogs, many of them have wait times of over a year.Walking around his own community, Kaya was a conversation starter. Lyle explained to curious neighbors why he had a service dog and why dogs can be so beneficial for veterans' mental health.Eventually, these conversations led him to draft and advocate before Congress for the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act, which was signed into law in 2021. The law requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to implement a five-year pilot program to provide training for service dogs for veterans with PTSD.Lyle said that in addition to performing specialized tasks, service dogs also act as ""an extraordinarily powerful backstop to veteran suicide."" Caring for the dog can help ""provide a sense of purpose.""""It's a very powerful backstop when somebody's feeling that lonely or depressed,"" he said.An emotional final flight homeA poignant video of Kaya's last flight to Dallas went viral this week after Lyle posted it to his own social media.He explained to CNN that she was diagnosed with cancer over Christmas and he made the decision to take her to Texas one last time, where she was born and where they spent years while he studied at Texas A&M University. A friend working at Southwest Airlines helped coordinate the flight, getting Kaya safely and comfortably onto the plane in a cart. Once on board, the staff made an announcement over the intercom explaining Kaya's story and encouraging passengers to ""show her some love"" on her last flight.When Lyle and Kaya disembarked the flight, ""hundreds of people were cheering and clapping for her and telling her 'welcome home' and 'thank you for your service,'"" Lyle said. ""It was really an extraordinary moment.""He said that he had ""no idea it was gonna go as viral as it did.""""But I'm glad it did, because Kaya's life and legacy deserve to be shared and honored.""Lyle described Kaya as ""a consummate professional"" when she was working. But when her working vest came off, ""she was a little diva"" who loved to play, he said.""What made her so extraordinary is that even before she was trained, she was very smart,"" he said. ""She was just such an intuitive dog.""Several politicians, including Kevin McCarthy and Ron DeSantis, posted tributes to Kaya on social media after her death.Lyle said that he hopes even after her death, Kaya's legacy can continue to fuel efforts to connect veterans with service dogs. ""Service dogs can save lives,"" he said.""I can't tell you how many veterans have messaged me and reached out to me in years past and even now and said, 'you know, Kaya inspired me to get my own dog, because I saw you talk about how powerful she was for you, and if I had not done that, I would have killed myself.' And I think that is Kaya's most profound and powerful legacy."""
91,Why Kim Jong Un wants you to meet his daughter,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/asia/kim-jong-un-daughter-succession-missiles-north-korea-intl-hnk/index.html,"The girl -- believed to be Kim's second child, Ju Ae, and around 9 years old -- joined the North Korean leader and his wife at a glitzy banquet at a Pyongyang military barracks on Tuesday night.A day later she looked on as at least 11 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) were paraded through KIm Il Sung Square in the North Korean capital.""By ostentatiously including his wife and daughter, Kim wants observers at home and abroad to see his family dynasty and the North Korean military as irrevocably linked,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.Meet the KimsThe Kim family's rule in North Korea stretches back to 1948, when Kim Il Sung came to power in the aftermath of World War II.When Kim Il Sung died in 1994, his son Kim Jong Il took control -- and when Kim Jong Il died, in December 2011, his son Kim Jong Un came to power.Western observers believe Kim Jong Un has three children and that Ju Ae is his middle child, though this can't be verified by anyone outside North Korea.North Korean media reports of this week's military events described Ju Ae as Kim's ""respected"" and ""beloved"" child.American basketball star Dennis Rodman revealed Kim had a baby called Ju Ae when he visited Pyongyang in 2013, telling The Guardian afterward, ""I held their baby Ju Ae and spoke with (Kim's wife) as well.""The age of the baby Rodman held appears to fit the age of the girl at this week's events.Isn't it a bit early for a successor?There is historical precedent for Kim to identify his successor so early on, because that's what his father, Kim Jong Il, did with him, said Cheong Seong-chang,​ a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.""It is known that Kim Jong Il told his aides that Kim Jong Un would be his successor while performing a song called 'Footsteps' to praise Kim Jong Un on his 8th birthday,"" Cheong said. However, he added that the outside world had not been aware of this at the time.""Rumors and speculations circulated for a long time that Kim Jong Il's first son, Kim Jong Nam, or second son, Kim Jong Chol, would be the successor,"" Cheong said.When did Kim's daughter take the spotlight?Speculation that Ju Ae would be Kim's successor emerged last November when state media released pictures of her and Kim inspecting a North Korean ballistic missile before a test launch.South Korean lawmaker and secretary of the National Intelligence Service Yoo Sang-bum said after that launch the girl was thought to be Ju Ae.North Korean state media published a story later that month with pictures of Kim and his daughter, describing her as his ""most beloved"" child, Cheong said.Pictures in North Korean media also showed the girl visiting a missile factory with her father near the end of 2022.The case for succession ...Cheong said he's convinced the girl's appearance at recent events and how she is referred to in state-run media show she is being primed to succeed her father.The state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper mentions the girl before Kim's wife in stories and uses the adjectives ""beloved"" and ""respected"" to convey on her a special status, he said.""The beginning of this personality cult for Kim Ju Ae suggests that, even though she has not yet (been given) the status of an official successor ... she is de facto designated successor,"" Cheong said.He added that if the girl is to succeed her father, she would need the support of the military.Putting her front and center at military events from a young age will allow her to establish credibility with the military over time, Cheong said. ... Or is this just a PR stunt?Other observers aren't convinced.Her recent appearances may simply be a way to redirect the world's attention back to Pyongyang's military after audience fatigue set in following a year of record missile testing, said Chun In-bum, a retired South Korean general.""I think the North Koreans have either stumbled upon or have figured out that this is one way of getting international attention. And so with all the interest that is accumulating, they're enjoying themselves,"" he said.""Throughout their seven-decade history, their successors have always been a mystery to us. Why would they change their mode of operation now? So if I were to bet $5, I would say she is not the successor,"" Chun said.And what about those missiles?While there's still plenty of debate about Ju Ae, there's little doubt about her father's wish to have enough military might to keep his family in power.The display of at least 11 Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) on Wednesday night shows the North Korean military is following through on Kim's call at the end of 2022 for an ""exponential increase"" in his country's nuclear arsenal in response to what he claims are threats from South Korea and the United States.Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said on social media that if each of those missiles were equipped with multiple nuclear warheads, they could represent enough volume to overwhelm US ballistic missile defenses.Solid fuel vs. liquid fuelFollowing the Hwasong-17s in Wednesday night's parade were examples of what analysts believe could be a solid-fueled ICBM, a step up in technology from the liquid-fueled Hwasong-17.Liquid-fueled missiles take longer to prepare for launch; solid-fueled missiles are ready to go on a moment's notice.""If this is the case, it gives (North Korea) more mobility, flexibility, lethality, and so forth,"" said Chun, the former South Korean general.Solid-fueled missiles on mobile launchers would give the Kim regime ""the ability to attack an opponent with very, very little prior warning,"" Chun said. ""It's a really scary scenario."""

CNN reported that Trump attorney Evan Corcoran appeared before the grand jury last month. The Wall Street Journal first reported Bobb's appearance.The move by special counsel Jack Smith to compel both Bobb and Corcoran to testify is an aggressive one, given that they both are lawyers to the former president. But it also marks how the investigation continues to push for answers on the lead-up to the August 2022 FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in the document-mishandling and obstruction of justice investigation. The two attorneys were involved in responding to the Justice Department on behalf of Trump, at a time when all classified records in his possession had been subpoenaed yet hundreds were not turned over.Corcoran and Bobb each had a role in telling prosecutors in writing that the Trump team had searched for documents and turned over all classified material in his possession last June.A lawyer for Bobb declined to comment on her interactions with the special counsel's investigation.The disclosure of the testimony also comes amid an escalation of activity in Smith's other Trump probe, looking into the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and efforts to impede the transfer of power following the 2020 election. Smith issued a subpoena in that investigation to former Vice President Mike Pence in recent days, seeking documents and testimony. Trump's former national security adviser Robert O'Brien also received a subpoena, as CNN first reported.This story has been updated with additional background."

Beyond their mission on the field, the two stars serve as inspiration for younger generations of football fans seeking a more inclusive version of one of the United States' most beloved sports. Hurts is in just his second season as a full-time starter. The Houston Texas native has had an MVP-caliber season, leading the team to a dominant 16-1 in games he started and finishing with an impressive 3,701 yards in the air with 22 touchdowns and six interceptions, along with 760 yards and 13 scores on the ground.At just 27 years old, Mahomes has a decorated resume and laundry list of accolades including two-time league MVP, Super Bowl MVP, and most importantly, Super Bowl Champion. This year, he joined Tom Brady as the only quarterback to start in three Super Bowls in their first six seasons. Entering this weekend, injuries are a minor concern for both signal-callers. Hurts is recovering from a right shoulder sprain he suffered back in December. Since the injury, his offensive production has declined slightly. Mahomes suffered a high ankle sprain in the divisional round against Jacksonville. He powered through the AFC title game, but hobbled a bit throughout the game. The good news for both athletes is that they have had a full two weeks to rest since they last took the field, which should bode well come Sunday. Reid Faces Familiar Foe Kansas City head coach Andy Reid has a shot at securing his second Super Bowl ring on Sunday -- against the first team he ever led to the Super Bowl. During his Eagles tenure, he guided the team to nine playoff runs, six division titles, five NFC Championship Games, and one Super Bowl appearance. He was fired at the end of the 2012 season, when the team finished with a dismal 4-12 record. He immediately joined the Chiefs, and has since reached double-digit wins in all but one season. With the rise of Mahomes, the Chiefs have been nearly unstoppable, reaching the title game in three of the last four years. While Reid will be held in high regard with or without a second ring, a win on Sunday would be a bow neatly tied on his coaching legacy. Brotherly Battle Back in 2017, Eagles' center Jason Kelce won his first Super Bowl. In 2019, Chiefs' tight end Travis Kelce won his first Super Bowl. In 2023, either Jason or Travis will win their second Super Bowl, as they become the first brothers in history to square off on the NFL's biggest stage. The duo from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, have long dreamed of sharing this experience. Before joining the NFL, they were teammates at the University of Cincinnati. Since then, they have built impressive professional careers.Travis is an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and four-time All-Pro, widely recognized for his flashy dance moves and exuberant personality. Jason is a six-time Pro Bowl selection and five-time All-Pro, known as a vocal leader and a workhorse on the offensive line. No matter the outcome on Sunday, the Kelce family will have something to celebrate. "

The boxes -- installed into exterior walls of designated hospitals or public safety buildings -- allow newborns to be placed in the devices, which then lock on the outside and trigger silent alarms, notifying staff members to secure the babies from inside the buildings.  The devices, by Safe Haven Baby Boxes, are meant to give distressed parents a safe place to drop off their newborns while remaining anonymous, preventing the illegal abandonment of newborns. The nonprofit has set up dozens of boxes across multiple states, according to its website.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in 2021 signed a law allowing the use of a ""newborn safety device"" for the anonymous surrendering of infants less than 30 days old at a participating staffed police station, staffed fire station, or a staffed hospital.""This child that was surrendered here was not abandoned.

Okobi's family and their attorneys had viewed a 25-30 minute composite video -- made up of witness cell phone video, surveillance footage and deputies' dashcam footage, San Mateo County District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe told CNN in 2018. The footage was released to the public in 2019.Okobi's sister said after viewing footage of the incident in 2018 that her brother was ""getting tortured to death in broad daylight.""In the family's news release Thursday, an attorney said ""the destiny of an unarmed Black man having a mental health crisis shouldn't be death at the hands of police.""""This happens far too easily and far too often and police officers should be regularly trained on de-escalation strategies for non-violent incidents, and not handed potentially lethal weapons with little training and no outside oversight,""  Adanté Pointer, an attorney for Okobi's mother, said.    Okobi was a Morehouse College graduate, a poet and a father to a young daughter, who was 12 years old at the time of his death, his family said. The family is calling for reform in Taser use by law enforcement, saying the devices ""kill hundreds of people like Chinedu every year,"" the release said.  "
98,BTS agency HYBE buys stake in its K-pop rival,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/media/south-korea-hybe-sm-entertainment-deal-intl-hnk/index.html,"The move strengthens HYBE's dominance in South Korea's music industry, where it is already the biggest player, even as it seeks to expand abroad.The South Korean entertainment giants announced the deal Friday, with HYBE set to pick up a 14.8% stake in SM Entertainment for 422.8 billion Korean won ($334.5 million).SM was founded by legendary music producer Lee Soo-man, who is widely referred to in South Korea as ""the godfather of K-pop."" The company is known for representing hit artists, such as NCT 127, EXO, BoA and Girls' Generation.News that the two companies were joining forces fired up investors. SM Entertainment's shares soared 16% in Seoul on Friday. HYBE's stock initially rose 3%, before paring gains to close down 1.5%.Outside of BTS, HYBE also represents prominent bands such as NewJeans, Tomorrow x Together and Seventeen. But its marquee act is currently on hiatus. Members of BTS started individual compulsory military service in South Korea late last year, and the group as a whole is expected to reconvene around 2025.Now, HYBE is turning its attention elsewhere.""This acquisition represents a major step by HYBE to integrate the global expertise of both companies to become a game changer in the global music industry,"" the company said in a statement.HYBE has been taking steps to expand its global reach. On Thursday, it announced another major deal in the United States, saying it would acquire the owner of Quality Control, a hip-hop label that represents popular artists including Migos and Lil Yachty.That deal will help HYBE build a stronger presence in the US music market, according to Sunhwa Lee, an internet and entertainment analyst at KB Securities. In a report Thursday, she noted that the company's broader ambitions were ""to go beyond the boundaries of K-pop and develop new global artists across various genres.""""This partnership is a vital part of our growth plan to innovate the entertainment industry through a diversified portfolio,"" HYBE Chairman Bang Si-Hyuk said in a statement. ""We will work together to continue adding depth of hip-hop to the global music industry.""'One-two punch'Bernie Cho, a Seoul-based music industry executive, said the two deals announced were unlike anything he'd seen.This ""may be the biggest one-two power punch I've ever seen or heard [of] in the history of the K-pop industry,"" said Cho, president of DFSB Kollective, a music artist and label services agency.He said the deals had the potential to put HYBE in the same league as the ""big three"" major record labels: Sony (SNE), Universal and Warner Music.""HYBE, in their post-BTS stage, have really stunned and surprised fans and financial analysts by really smart, really savvy huge deals,"" he added.In 2019, BTS accounted for as much as 90% of revenue at its management company, then known as Big Hit Entertainment. That left analysts concerned that the firm, later renamed to HYBE, was overreliant on the band.Since then, however, HYBE has expanded its roster.In recent years, its slate has grown to include other global celebrities, including Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato, who are represented by a team under HYBE's US subsidiary.The South Korean firm has also has a tie-up with Big Machine Label Group, an affiliate that oversees some of the top artists in country music, such as Sheryl Crowe, Rascal Flatts and Tim McGraw.""HYBE is no longer a K-pop juggernaut. The K has now become silent,"" said Cho. ""They've become a pop music juggernaut."""

And on Friday, to the delight of fans, the two giants of the game will meet each other in the grand final of the Airthings Masters with $30,000 on the line. The pair met only a few days ago in the tournament's winner's final on Wednesday, with Carlsen winning in the Armageddon decider by bidding just one second less than Nakamura to get the black pieces, therefore only needing a draw to go through. In Armageddon chess, normal rules apply apart from two distinctions: black has draw odds, meaning that if black draws the game, then they win, and black starts with less time on the clock than white.In other tournaments, world No. 6 Nakamura would have had to settle for a final loss and head home. But in the Airthings Masters, he was offered one final opportunity to qualify for the grand final, playing Wesley So in the loser's final. With his victory in the Armageddon game, Nakamura gave himself another opportunity to dethrone the reigning champion Carlsen. In the uniquely formatted Airthings Masters, if Carlsen was to lose the grand final, there would be a reset final -- a best of three encounter. Despite beating Nakamura last time out, five-time world champion Carlsen said their game was ""really, really poor quality,"" admitting he was surprised by the early finish of the games in the losers bracket. ""This was one of the days that I woke up after a long, long sleep,"" the 32-year-old explained. ""I had some breakfast, maybe too much breakfast, because afterwards I was spent and I could not recover for the whole match, so I think the match was of really, really poor quality, and I think Hikaru would agree as well.""Although historically Carlsen has had the better of games against Nakamura, in the cauldron of a final who knows what could happen. The grand final begins at 11am ET and will be decided in a best of five games format, including an Armageddon tie-break. Not only is a $30,000 first prize stake on the line, but also a place in the $2 million Champions Chess Tour Play-Off in December."
102,Adidas says dropping Kanye West could cost it more than $1 billion in sales,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/adidas-yeezy-billion-loss/index.html,"The company warned Thursday that it's expected to lose $1.3 billion (1.2 billion euro) in revenue this year because it's unable to sell the designer's Yeezy clothing and shoes. Adidas ended its nine-year partnership with the rapper last October because of his antisemitic remarks. In a statement, Adidas said its financial guidance for 2023 ""accounts for the significant adverse impact from not selling the existing stock."" If the company can't ""repurpose"" any of the remaining Ye clothing, Adidas said that could cost the company $534 million (500 million euro) in operating profit this year.The company said shortly after the partnership was dissolved that it would try to sell the clothing, stripped of the Yeezy name and branding. Adidas said selling the sneakers under its own branding would save the company about $300 million in royalty payments and marketing fees.Despite that attempt, Adidas is going to have problems repurposing his clothing, an analyst previously told CNN. ""There really are no good options for this distressed brand that sat somewhere between prestige and luxury,"" said Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group.Other options include destroying it or donating unsold Yeezy clothing.Adidas said it also expects ""one-off costs"" of $213 million (200 million euro) because of a ""strategic review"" the company is currently undergoing. ""The numbers speak for themselves. We are currently not performing the way we should,"" said Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden in a statement. He was named the company's top leader in January and joined from rival Puma. Adidas said last year that it ended its partnership with Ye because it ""does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech"" and said his comments were ""unacceptable, hateful and dangerous."" Adidas said they violated the company's ""values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness."" Last fall, Adidas put the ""partnership under review"" after Ye wore a ""White Lives Matter"" T-shirt in public. The Anti-Defamation League categorizes the phrase as a ""hate slogan"" used by White supremacist groups, including the Ku Klux Klan. He also said ""I can say antisemitic s*** and Adidas cannot drop me,"" during a tirade against Jews on a podcast.Adidas did not mention potential issues with its Beyoncé-led Ivy Park brand. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that sales of the once-trendy streetwear brand fell 50% last year to about $40 million — way below its internal projections of $250 million. The partnership is ""strong and successful,"" Adidas told the Journal in response.Shares of Adidas (ADDDF) tanked about 11% in Frankfurt trading. Adidas stock has dropped 45% over the past year."
103,Florida officials discussed AP African American Studies course with College Board for months before initial rejection,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/us/florida-african-american-ap/index.html,"More details emerged in two letters this week between the non-profit College Board and the Florida Department of Education about officials' communications related to the Advanced Placement course rejected last month by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential front-runner for the 2024 GOP nomination for president.Florida officials last month said they objected to some of the authors and topics -- including Black queer studies and Black feminism -- that were initially part of the course but were not included when its official framework was released this month. The course was shaped only by experts and under AP principles and practices, said the College Board, which has denied critics' accusations it's been influenced by political pressure. In a Tuesday letter, the Florida Department of Education writes it was ""grateful"" to see the changes in the course and appears to indicate it has not yet decided whether to approve it, as it asks the College Board to resubmit the class for consideration.In the letter, Florida officials list email exchanges with the College Board starting in January 2022 and meetings in the later part of that year in which they asked if the AP African American Studies course complies with state laws and regulations, including House Bill 7 -- the so-called ""Stop WOKE Act,"" which said schools cannot teach that anyone is inherently racist or responsible for past atrocities because of their skin color. Florida officials in a July email stated the course's ""preview materials appear to include content that may not be permissible,"" according to the letter. CNN has requested a copy of that email and other documents mentioned in the letter, which the Florida Department of Education did not immediately provided. Weeks after the July email, a representative with the College Board said the course did not conflict with state laws -- but by September, the department issued a memo stating the course could not be added without revisions, the letter says.State Education Department officials and College Board representatives met at least two times to discuss the concerns, the letter states, before the state rejected the course last month.  In a Wednesday letter responding to the Education Department, the College Board says it never got written feedback from state officials ""specifying how the course violates Florida law, despite repeated requests."" The timeline shared by the department states the College Board said during a November meeting that items such as 'systemic marginalization' and 'intersectionality' were integral elements of the course and could not be removed."" The College Board disputed claims course content was removed ""at behest of FDOE"" and explained changes in the course were made after prioritizing what is essential for college credit after data collected from college faculty indicated ""a need to reduce the number of topics in the pilot framework by 20%.""  In its letter, the College Board says it provides some information to states about courses while they're being developed and consider their concerns if they are ""academically valid."" ""Many AP courses, especially those based in history and culture, deal with contested topics. The AP Program navigates those challenging waters by relying on our AP Principles. These principles make it abundantly clear that we stand against censorship and indoctrination equally,"" the College Board says in the letter. In the case of the African American Studies course, the College Board briefed Florida officials on the content of the final framework only after it was made public on February 1, the organization says. No topics were removed due to a lack of education value, and no Black scholars or authors have been removed from the course, the group also notes.""If Florida or any state chooses not to adopt this course, we would regret that decision, and we believe educators and students would as well. We look forward to continuing to work together to deliver opportunities for Florida students,"" the College Board says."

105,Florida lawmakers vote to back expansion of DeSantis' migrant relocation plan,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/migrant-relocation-florida-ron-desantis-expansion/index.html,"The measure, now headed to DeSantis' desk after passing the GOP-led House on a 77-34 vote, would allow his administration to pick up where the governor left off last year when he sent two planes of migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The attention-grabbing act thrust DeSantis into the middle of the national debate on immigration, earning the potential 2024 hopeful praise from conservatives and widespread condemnation from migrant advocacy groups and the White House.The program had stalled amid multiple legal challenges and questions as to whether the DeSantis administration had violated state law by rounding up migrants in Texas. The budget law that created the $12 million program specified that the money was set aside to relocate ""unauthorized aliens from this state.""At DeSantis' urging, lawmakers meeting in a special session this week voted to remove the restriction on where the state could pick up migrants. The program would also come under the purview of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Because DeSantis has declared a state of emergency related to immigration, this would allow the administration to award millions of dollars in no-bid contracts to companies to move migrants across the country with little public disclosure.The legislation comes as Florida has experienced a spike of migrants from Cuba and Haiti attempting to reach the state's coast by boat. However, the bill's sponsor, GOP state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, said giving the DeSantis administration freedom to conduct missions outside of Florida would help stem the flow of migrants into the state.""The state of Florida is currently in a state of emergency because of the ineptness and the incompetence of the federal government when it comes to immigration policy,"" Ingoglia said Tuesday during a committee hearing on the bill. ""In fact, I would say that someone should declare the federal government itself its own disaster area.""The bill passed the state House on Friday over the strong objections of Democrats, who said the state does not have a constitutional role in addressing the country's immigration issues. It passed the state Senate on a 27-12 party-line vote Wednesday. Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers.  ""There's nobody at this table who honestly thinks that we have a good immigration policy right now,"" state Sen. Jason Pizzo, a Miami Democrat, said at a news conference Monday. ""There's no one at this table who will say Joe Biden is doing a great job with immigration. However, it's their authority.""In September, individuals working on behalf of the DeSantis administration in San Antonio convinced 49 migrants -- most if not all asylum-seekers from Venezuela -- to board two flights headed to Martha's Vineyard. As the migrants arrived in Massachusetts to the confusion of locals, DeSantis took credit for arranging the mission during an appearance on Fox News.Public records have since shed light on the clandestine mission, which included hiring a company with close ties to a DeSantis administration official to arrange the flights and using a woman named ""Perla"" to help convince migrants to take the flights.Attorneys for the migrants have filed a class-action lawsuit, saying their clients were misled into agreeing to the flights and had been told that they would arrive to find housing, jobs and help with the immigration process. In fact, nobody on Martha's Vineyard even knew they were coming, local officials have said. A migrant who aided Perla told CNN that he was misled into helping her recruit migrants for the trip. On Wednesday, Ingoglia said it was on the migrants to inform the federal government of their location. He insisted that the state would only transport people voluntarily and said that so-called sanctuary jurisdictions are better equipped to provide resources for migrants than Florida.Under the legislation, $10 million would be reallocated to the program under the state Division of Emergency Management for use through June. DeSantis in his proposed budget set aside another $12 million to continue the program. Democrats suggested that Republicans were retroactively cleaning up DeSantis' missteps during the mission to Martha's Vineyard and helping him raise his profile so he can run for president in 2024.""What we're doing right now is carrying the water for the governor, knowing that what he did was wrong, and you are holding your nose to vote for this and saying that it's right,"" said state Sen. Shevrin Jones. ""This is wrong. It is not becoming of us as a state. It is not becoming of us as human beings, and it's definitely not becoming of our resources and how we are about to spend taxpayers' dollars.""State Sen. Debbie Mayfield, a Republican, bristled at that suggestion. ""If the federal government was doing their job and securing our border, we would not have to be addressing this issue in Florida,"" she said. ""To me, it's just that simple.""The governor's controversial flights could resume between now and mid-March after Vertol Systems, the contractor for the program that flew migrants to Martha's Vineyard, filed an extension to its proposals for two additional migrant flights through March 15, according to new documents obtained by CNN.CNN previously reported that Vertol Systems was paid $950,000 by the Florida Department of Transportation to fly migrants from Texas to Illinois and Delaware, however, those flights were never conducted. In total, Vertol Systems has received $1,565,000 from the state under DeSantis' program.Vertol Systems has repeatedly refused to comment on the migrant flights, or answer any of CNN's inquiries about their contract. This story has been updated with additional details."
106,Gautam Adani will be playing defense for a while after mauling by short seller,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/india-adani-hindenburg-report-impact-intl-hnk/index.html,"The sprawling Adani Group, which he founded over 30 years ago, has established interests in industries ranging from logistics to mining. It hasn't stopped there. In the last few years, the tycoon has launched an astonishing expansion drive, moving into fields as diverse as media, data centers and airports, fueled by a borrowing binge.But the trouncing his conglomerate has received in the three weeks since Hindenburg Research accused it of ""the largest con in corporate history"" may mark a big shift in his business strategy, analysts said. ""Until this report came out, if there was anything that was on sale in India, Adani would buy it,"" said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Piper Serica Advisors. ""The easy money they had access to is history now,"" he added, referring to the ease with which the group was able to raise capital for big acquisitions. Adani's juggernaut, worth over $200 billion earlier this year, has borrowed $30 billion, making it one of the most indebted businesses in the country. Adani Group has published a 400-page rebuttal of the claims made in a January 24 report by Hindenburg, an American short seller. But that didn't stop a brutal stock market meltdown that destroyed over 50% of the group's value, and wiped over $60 billion from Adani's personal fortune. The entrepreneur was Asia's richest man before the report came out and now occupies the 21st spot on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.This week has remained turbulent for the group. While shares enjoyed a brief rebound mid-week, most of the 10 listed firms controlled by the conglomerate fell again in Mumbai on Friday. The blows keep comingThe last two days have brought more bad news, including a major index provider, MSCI, reducing the weightings of some of the group's companies Thursday after it reviewed the proportion of shares not held by insiders. That means investors tracking an index will have to cut their holdings in those companies.""We view this as validation of our findings on offshore stock parking by Adani,"" Hindenburg founder Nate Anderson said on Twitter. In its report, Hindenburg had alleged that ""offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest 'public' holders of Adani stock.""An Adani Group spokesperson declined to comment.On Friday, Moody's downgraded to negative from stable the outlook for the credit ratings of some Adani Group companies, including Adani Green Energy and two subsidiaries of Adani Transmission. It cited the ""significant and rapid decline"" in stock market values following the Hindenburg report. Meanwhile, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said Thursday it had ""for all practical purposes...fully divested"" from the Adani companies. The world's biggest holder of equities had started shedding its stake long before the Hindenburg report was published. One of Adani's biggest international partners, TotalEnergies, said Wednesday that it has put a green hydrogen deal with the group on hold. ""It was announced, nothing was signed. It doesn't exist,"" said Patrick Pouyanne, the CEO of the French oil giant. ""Mr Adani has other things to deal with now.""It's payback timeThose other things include repaying debt to calm investors and financiers. Moody's said last week that the plunge in the value of Adani companies was likely to reduce the group's ability to raise capital.He needs to ""forget about aggressive acquisitions and focus on giving cash back to lenders,"" said Agarwal. The besieged group has already taken some steps in that direction. On Monday, it said it will be paying back loans worth $1.11 billion ahead of their scheduled maturity in September 2024. The loans were backed by shares in Adani Ports, Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission. The next day, Adani Ports, India's largest private port operator, said ""the company is considering total loan repayment and prepayment"" of around $605 million, which would ""significantly"" improve its debt to earnings ratio. Adani Ports operates Mundra Port, often called the group's ""crown jewel,"" and is located in the western Indian state of Gujarat. Its shares are up over 17% this week. Despite these defensive moves, experts say that shares of Adani companies — including the flagship Adani Enterprises — will continue to see a much-needed correction in value.""I still think the company is priced too high, given its fundamentals and before factoring the damage that might have [been] done to the company's reputation and long term value, by this short selling episode,"" Aswath Damodaran, who teaches corporate finance and valuation at New York University, wrote in a blog post last weekend.Analysts have warned that questions about the health of Adani's empire are clouding the outlook for India Inc. Some of the biggest industrialists in the country have started sharing their views.Anand Mahindra, chairman of the autos-to-technology conglomerate, said ""never, ever bet against India,"" in a tweet last week.Uday Kotak, India's richest banker according to Bloomberg's wealth index, said this week on Twitter that he does ""not see systemic risk to Indian financial system from recent events,"" but added that the country needs to strengthen ""underwriting and capacity building.""""[L]arge Indian corporates rely more on global sources for debt and equity finance. This creates challenges and vulnerabilities,"" he said.This view was reiterated in a report by Fitch Ratings this week. ""Even under a hypothetical scenario where the wider Adani Group enters distress, exposure for Indian banks should, in itself, be manageable."" it said. ""We currently believe the economic and sovereign implications of the Adani controversy remain limited.""And CreditSights, a research firm owned by Fitch Group, said in a Tuesday report that the exposure of the State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, to the Adani Group was ""well-manageable."""
107,Biden gears up to hear from the nation's governors in Washington,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/president-biden-governors-winter-meeting/index.html,"Biden's remarks at the meeting with the governors revisited many of the same themes he brought up earlier this week during the State of the Union address, showcasing the real world impact of the laws passed over the last two years. Speaking to the House chamber on Tuesday, the president gave an optimistic perception of the nation despite vocal opposition from some Republicans in the room. His speech -- which focused heavily on core domestic issues and took sharp aim at GOP proposals -- has been widely viewed as a test run for his potential reelection announcement. Since Tuesday's address, Biden has taken his policies on the road -- most recently traveling to Tampa, Florida, to contrast his approach to social safety net policies with GOP efforts to cut Medicare and Social Security. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hosted the governors, in town for the National Governors Association's winter meeting, on Friday in the East Room. On Saturday, Biden, Harris and their spouses will also attend a black tie dinner at the White House with the governors. Biden told governors at Friday's meeting that he doesn't believe congressional Republicans are ""serious"" about playing hardball with the debt ceiling in remarks to the nation's governors at the White House. ""I believe we can be fiscally responsible without threatening our country,"" Biden said. ""I don't think my colleagues are really serious -- I hope they're not -- about holding the debt hostage to cuts they want to make in certain things that I may or may not want to make.""  The US hit the debt ceiling in January, forcing the federal government to take extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bill. The federal government faces the possibility of a catastrophic default later this summer if Congress cannot come to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling. Ahead of in-person meetings with the governors, the White House highlighted a recent statement from the NGA that called on Congress ""to increase or suspend the debt limit as soon as possible."" Hardline Republicans have argued that lifting the borrowing cap be tied to spending reductions, and the NGA's statement is in line with Biden's repeated call on Congress to come to consensus on the matter. ""Failure on the part of the Treasury Department to meet its federal obligations would create significant uncertainty and risk to American citizens, government services, and global financial markets,"" the statement from the NGA, which represents all 55 of the nation's governors, continued. During Friday's meeting, the president highlighted massive amounts of federal funding delivered to states to follow through with some of the major policies enacted since he took office. Biden told the governors he thinks ""one of the things we have a chance to do this year is disprove that ... we're just a broken system, that we're divided, we're just based on extremes in both parties and we can't get anything done.""Harris similarly emphasized that she thinks ""the theme of this year should be, for all of us, momentum."" ""There is so much good and important work that happened over the last two years, as a very specific moment in time in our country -- and era, if you will. Not just a political season,"" she continued. ""And we are now at a point, we're coming through the height of the crisis. But with the good work that's been done to deal with an immediate issue that required long term thinking, we are now on the verge of building on that in a way that, together through a partnership, will benefit the people of our country for generations.""New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said during the meeting that there's a ""certain pride"" within the NGA that ""we can consistently come together and disprove the narrative that politics has gotten completely divisive."" Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters after the White House meeting that the group ""talked extensively about securing the border and ... the fentanyl piece as well as the immigration piece."" He said they spoke about what they could do ""to fix legal immigration."" They also discussed states' implementation of bipartisan legislation, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act.A White House official told CNN ahead of Friday's meeting that ""all 55 governors from every state and territory were invited to the National Governor Association's Winter Meeting, to the business meeting at the White House, and to the dinner for governors at the White House on Saturday.""However, there were some notable Republican governors who were absent, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Last year, a bipartisan group of governors in town for the winter meeting used their time in Washington to bend Biden's ear on easing Covid-19 restrictions. And this year, amid poll numbers suggesting Americans want a new Democrat to be the 2024 presidential nominee, nearly a dozen Democratic governors are using their platform in Washington to express their support for a second Biden term. Murphy told reporters on Thursday that Biden's State of the Union address and Republicans' reactions -- from repeated heckling in the chamber to Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' response -- showed a clear contrast between the parties. ""Between the crazy behavior from that right-wing group of folks who heckled him, (and) his statesman-like, substantive ... remarks, and then the reply, which was all about culture wars? This guy is running and he's got to get reelected and we're all behind him,"" Murphy, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, said alongside 10 other Democratic governors. Their vocal support for Biden follows a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll that found 6 in 10 Democratic and Democratic leaning independents say they'd like the party to nominate someone other than Biden. Biden recently reiterated in a PBS NewsHour interview this week that he intends to run for reelection, but hasn't made that decision yet. First lady Jill Biden was also scheduled to host governors' spouses on Friday for a luncheon at the White House. However, the first lady's office announced Friday morning that she would no longer attend because she was feeling ill. The first lady's spokesperson, Vanessa Valdivia, told CNN, ""The First Lady is feeling under the weather, has tested negative for COVID, and will not be participating in today's scheduled events.""Jill Biden is also slated to host a service project with the governors' spouses Saturday afternoon as part of her Joining Forces initiative.This story has been updated with additional developments on Friday."
108,'When does time finally run out?' Richard Glossip has maintained his innocence for 26 years on death row. A special counsel is now reviewing his case,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/us/richard-glossip-interview-oklahoma-death-row/index.html,"Glossip, who's been behind bars for 26 years on a capital murder conviction, now has a tablet in his cell at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and can use it to make collect phone calls.""It's one of the scariest things, especially if you're an innocent person, to know they're going to take your life for something you had nothing to do with,"" Glossip told CNN in an exclusive interview during one of those phone calls.Last month, Glossip learned of his ninth execution date: May 18. For years, he's been dealt a string of reprieves and stays, and this latest date comes at the order of newly elected Oklahoma Attorney General, Gentner Drummond.""It is my responsibility to ensure that we are appropriately responding to all evidence that has been presented through Mr. Glossip's conviction and incarceration,"" Drummond said in a statement. ""Circumstances surrounding this case necessitate a thorough review.""Drummond's office appointed an independent special counsel to lead that review. Glossip's attorney, Don Knight, called it ""hugely significant,"" and ""the right thing to do.""""Anybody who looks at this case has to come to the same result and that's what this whole purpose is, making sure everyone sees the truth,"" said Glossip.In August, Oklahoma said it planned to execute 24 death row inmates through 2024, despite cries by critics and experts who pointed not only to outstanding questions of the mental fitness or possible innocence of some but also the state's recent history of botched lethal injections. In recent weeks, the state adjusted that pace to about one man every 60 days at Drummond's request, citing a burden on the corrections department.Convicted of murder-for-hire Glossip, a former motel manager, is convicted of murder for ordering the 1997 killing of his boss, Barry Van Treese.Another employee, then-19-year-old Justin Sneed, admitted to killing Van Treese with a baseball bat in Oklahoma City. But prosecutors told jurors Sneed did so in a murder-for-hire plot masterminded by Glossip. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his testimony against Glossip.Glossip has always maintained his innocence. He was first convicted and sentenced in 1998, but that was overturned in 2001 because of ineffective defense counsel. He was again convicted in 2004 and again sentenced to death.""You do scream it and scream it, and then finally somebody stands up and says, 'There's something to this,'"" says Glossip of his lawyer Knight, who began representing him in 2015.That year, Glossip was more than an hour past his execution time when the governor issued a stay based on the constitutionality of the state's execution protocols. Glossip has been on the verge of execution three times before, even being served three separate last meals, according to his attorney.Knight, along with his paralegal Meri Wright, have experienced highs and lows in their pursuit to exonerate Glossip.""It's hard to not feel emotionally attached to the case, but also to Rich himself,"" Wright told CNN. ""It's an extraordinary burden to try to save another human being's life.""November dealt another legal setback, when the Oklahoma Criminal Court Appeals denied a petition for a hearing on new evidence in the case.It followed an explosive, more than 300-page report released by international law firm Reed Smith that concluded, ""No reasonable juror hearing the complete record would have convicted Richard Glossip of first-degree murder.""The report was commissioned by a bi-partisan group of 34 state lawmakers and led by state Republican Kevin McDugle, who has vowed to repeal the death penalty in Oklahoma if Glossip is executed.McDugle told CNN the report changed the minds of many of his colleagues who believe in capital punishment but want to ensure the state's death penalty process is just.New evidence uncoveredWithin the last year, Reed Smith and Glossip's defense team have uncovered even more evidence that they say proves Glossip's innocence.Among the documents is a letter from Sneed to his attorney, in which Glossip's defense argues he may have been trying to recant his testimony.""There are a lot of things right now that are eating at me. Somethings I need to clean up,"" Sneed wrote in the letters, which were shown to CNN by Glossip's defense and are part of an amendment to Reed Smith's initial report.In another letter, Sneed wrote, ""Do I have the choice of recanting my testimony at any time during my life...""In a separate letter shown to CNN, Sneed's public defender responded to one of his letters saying, ""I can tell by the tone of your letter that some things are bothering you... Had you refused (to testify against Glossip) you would most likely be on death row right now.""The Oklahoma County public defender's office, responsible for Sneed's attorney at the time, declined to comment.""We always suspected that Justin Sneed really wanted to, at some point, tell the truth,"" Knight said. ""But from those papers, we could tell that even though he was trying to, his lawyer at the time was telling him, 'Don't do it.'""What happens nextThe special counsel appointed by the state attorney general began their deep dive into the case last month.There is no deadline for a report on the findings, but it will be ""before the state pardon and parole board meets, scheduled for April 12,"" a spokesperson for Drummond's office told CNN.The office also said the attorney general spoke to the Van Treese family before ordering the review. Van Treese's sister declined to comment to CNN for this story.In the meantime, Glossip waits.He said he has made peace with his situation and tries to accomplish something every day.He writes poetry. He speaks to his wife -- whom he married last year -- on his tablet phone each day. He watches religious services at their church on television so he can see her on camera.He said he's looking forward to their first anniversary, which he wouldn't have been able to celebrate had this latest delay not happened.And he prays for more people to hear his cries of innocence.""I've been through this so many times,"" Glossip said.""It's still scary, it will always be scary until they finally open this door and let me go, or remove this from over my head completely, so I don't have to worry about, 'Are they going to kill me next month? Or the month after that? When does time finally run out?'"""

111,"Most young people aren't getting latest Covid-19 booster, but they're not filling hospital beds at three large health care systems",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/health/bivalent-covid-vaccine-younger-people/index.html,"""Even if they're not getting boosted, young, healthy people are not getting super sick from this,"" said Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, a senior vice president at Northwell Health, the largest health care provider in New York state. ""We're not seeing it. It's not happening.""  The US Food and Drug Administration has proposed a framework for annual Covid vaccinations for all Americans over the age of 6 months, but at a meeting with its vaccine advisers last month, it did not come up with a concrete plan. Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are scheduled to meet February 24 to discuss the future of the US Covid-19 vaccination program.  Uptake of the bivalent booster, which has been available since September, has been low. Nationally, only about 16% of the population has gotten it, and the rates are especially low for people under 65, according to CDC data. Narasimhan and doctors at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City and Clalit Health Services, Israel's largest health care organization, say the relative mildness of current Covid strains, along with a degree of immunity from previous vaccinations and infections, are going a long way toward protecting healthy young people, even if they don't get the booster.  Dr. Ran Balicer, director of the Clalit Research Institute and chairman of Israel's Covid-19 National Expert Advisory Panel, noted that at earlier points in the pandemic -- for example, when the virulent Delta variant was raging -- it was ""not responsible"" to opt out of the vaccine.  ""I don't think that's the case anymore,"" he said. ""I think when you're under 65 and healthy, it's a much more complex question, and I think that's where individual risk assessment and personal preferences come into play.""  Since the new booster became available, about 12% of all Covid deaths in the US have been among people younger than 65, according to CDC data.   A report released by the CDC on Thursday analyzed death rates and vaccination status from September through December. It showed that people who were vaccinated -- either with only the original vaccine or with an updated booster in addition -- were better protected than those who were unvaccinated.  The updated booster helps protect against both the original strain of the coronavirus and more recent Omicron strains. It was particularly effective at reducing death rates in older people and less effective for younger people. For adults younger than 65, the bivalent booster offered at least three times better protection from death than just the original vaccine -- but the difference in death rates was less than one in a million. The CDC recommends the updated booster to everyone over age 6 months, but a government advertising campaign focuses on the importance of the shot for people over 50.""We're not surprised, and we're grateful [and] happy to see that hospitals aren't filling up"" with people under age 65, said Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles, a CDC senior epidemiologist and lead author of several studies on the booster's effectiveness. ""But we still see occasionally healthy younger adults end up in the hospital. And to me, it's a no-brainer if I can take five minutes, pop into my local pharmacy and get a shot.""  ""There are people under 65 that are still dying of Covid, (and) any death in an unvaccinated or under-vaccinated person is potentially preventable had that person gotten the booster,"" she added.Link-Gelles said the CDC wants to avoid overly complicated guidelines for the new booster, with different suggestions for different age groups.  ""We generally across the board see higher uptake of vaccination with simpler vaccine recommendations,"" she said. ""That's one of the things we're trying to accomplish here.""  Data from three large health care systems  In October, as President Joe Biden rolled up his sleeve to get the new booster, he urged other Americans to do the same.  For people who are fully vaccinated, ""our nation's health experts recommend that they get the updated Covid vaccine once a year,"" Biden said at a White House briefing. ""Nearly every death is preventable [so] get your updated Covid shot.""  By and large, Americans haven't listened. While 41% of those over age 65 have received the booster, only 12% of those ages 5 to 64 have opted to get it, according to CDC data.   Data from the three large health care systems in New York and Israel since September 1 indicate that the low booster uptake for people under 65 has not led to high Covid hospitalization rates for this group.  At Northwell, about 1,224 patients under the age of 65 have been admitted with severe Covid-19 in that time period.  ""This is a large hospital system with [21] hospitals, so this is a small number in the big picture of Northwell,"" Narasimhan said.  Of the patients under 65 hospitalized with Covid, half had never received a Covid-19 vaccine shot of any kind, 42% had had one or two shots, and 7% had had three shots; 72% also had underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease, according to an analysis done by Northwell for CNN.  At Montefiore Medical Center, about 300 patients under age 65 were hospitalized for Covid-19. Among those, 32% were unvaccinated, 10% were partially vaccinated, and 58% were fully vaccinated; 82% also had underlying conditions, according to Dr. Inessa Gendlina, an infectious disease expert and assistant professor at Einstein Montefiore Department of Medicine.At Clalit, 1.2% of 4.5 million members under the age of 65 have opted to get the updated booster, according to Balicer. Covid hospitalization rates for that age group have been ""low"" since September: less than 5 per 100,000 people per month. In the US, Covid hospitalization rates are trending down, with an average of about 3,800 new admissions each day for people of all ages, less than 1,000 of which have been among people under age 60, as of the last week of January, according to the CDC. That data includes patients who were hospitalized for reasons unrelated to the virus but who tested positive while hospitalized, according to the agency.  The strength of the Northwell, Montefiore and Clalit data is that they're large systems that make a distinction between patients who were hospitalized specifically because of Covid and those who incidentally tested positive for Covid while in the hospital for a different reason.Experts disagree on boosting healthy young people  When the bivalent booster came out in September, Balicer, the chairman of Israel's Covid-19 National Expert Advisory Panel, did not get it.  ""I am not in any risk group, and I'm below 65, so I did not hurry to take my bivalent,"" said Balicer, who is in his late 40s and does not provide direct care to patients.  His reasoning was that if he didn't get the booster and came down with Covid, he probably would not get very sick given the relative mildness of the prevailing strain, some immunity from his three previous vaccinations and a bout with Covid last year. Also, he figured that if he did get the booster, it probably would not provide long-term protection from infection. ""Because I was vaccinated before, I know my risk of severe morbidity is very low"" even without the booster, he said. ""And I know that the protection from infection that I will get from the additional booster will be short-term -- a few months.""  But in late November, Balicer decided to get the shot because he had to travel abroad to attend ""long and important"" meetings, which involved several 12-hour flights and sitting with large groups of people in small rooms with little ventilation.  ""I did not want to risk becoming ill with Covid during that stay. I made a personal risk assessment"" to get the vaccine, even though he knew he might feel a bit sick the day after getting it, he said.  Some experts interviewed by CNN say that although the booster is important for elderly and for immune-compromised people, the decision whether to get it is somewhat murky for younger, healthy people.  Narasimhan, 51 and a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwell, said although there's data showing that the shot protects people over age 65 and those who are immune-compromised from dying or ending up in the hospital, ""young, healthy people don't necessarily need to get boosted.""  She said she and her young adult children got the booster because they live with a frail, elderly relative, and they want to do everything they can to decrease their chances of getting infected and passing it to him. But she said people in different situations might not make the same decision.  Dr. Nadav Davidovitch, 53, head of the School of Public Health at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, said he got the booster and urged his family members to get it.  ""I told them it's a good idea. But when I'm talking to someone over 50 or who has chronic conditions, I'm pushing it more,"" he said. ""For young people, it's a matter of choice. There are different personalities and risk perceptions. I won't say it's a major mistake for a person who's 20-something not to get the booster.""  For young, healthy people, personal circumstances matter, he said.  ""It's the context of who you're living with and visiting, so for example, maybe for health workers, it would be more important to get it,"" said Davidovitch, who chairs the Covid-19 Task Force at the Association of Public Health Schools in the European Region.Data shows that the booster provides ""a modest degree of protection"" against symptomatic Covid compared to those who'd been previously vaccinated, and ""it's likely that increased vaccination among all or most people helps slow the spread of disease and reduce the chances they infect someone at high risk of severe disease,"" according to a statement from CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund.However, experts interviewed by CNN questioned whether the protection conferred by the booster is sufficient to prevent transmission of the virus.  Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that although it's ""noble"" to think that getting the booster will help protect others, the shot is much less effective at preventing transmission compared with the original vaccine at earlier points in the pandemic.  ""Your chances of getting infected are altered very little with the [booster], so you can't say with any scientific integrity that protecting others is why you should get it,"" said Osterholm, who in a recent podcast emphasized the importance of getting boosted if you're at higher risk for serious illness.   ""My focus is on people who are 65 and older and those who are immune-compromised. That's who I think really should get"" the booster, Osterholm told CNN, noting that more people in those groups need to go out and get the shot.   On one end of the spectrum of debate over the booster, Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, has argued against campaigns to convince healthy young people to get the shot.  ""Booster dosing is probably best reserved for the people most likely to need protection against severe disease -- specifically, older adults, people with multiple coexisting conditions that put them at high risk for serious illness, and those who are immunocompromised,"" Offit, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.   ""In the meantime, I believe we should stop trying to prevent all symptomatic infections in healthy, young people by boosting them with vaccines containing mRNA from strains that might disappear a few months later,"" he added.  Offit, who notes that he's 71 and has no underlying health issues, did not get the new booster. He has had three doses of the original vaccine and contracted Covid once and he says he would have considered himself protected against severe disease with either three doses of the original vaccine or two doses plus an infection. On the other end of the spectrum, some experts do think it's important for young, healthy people to get the new booster.  ""I strongly encourage those under 65 to get the booster, especially those in the 40 to 64 range,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccinologist whose team at Texas Children's Hospital developed a Covid-19 vaccine used in India and Indonesia. ""You can still see a lot of severe Covid, and long Covid can occur with any infection.""  Gendlina, the infectious disease doctor at Montefiore, who is in her mid-40s, said she got the booster as soon as it came out and recommended it to her family, including her teenage son.  ""As we're stepping away from masking, it's more and more important to get vaccinated,"" she said.  Link-Gelles, the CDC epidemiologist, is 38, and she says she got the booster for several reasons, including that her husband is immune-compromised, they have a daughter in day care and they visit elderly relatives. ""Vaccination to me seems like a slam dunk,"" she said. ""It's very easy to get, [and] you don't have to worry again for a while. It's not going to be perfect, but it is going to provide you some degree of protection and therefore protection against infecting someone else.""  "
112,Why Biden shouldn't dismiss his negative poll numbers,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/polling-election-2024-biden-trump/index.html,"Biden is upset because of recent polling findings that a lot of Democrats would be happy if he didn't run and that put former President Donald Trump ahead of Biden (though within the margin of error) in a hypothetical 2024 contest.  To be clear, I believe Biden would very likely win the Democratic nomination and would have a good chance of winning a general election. But I have to defend the polling he went after. Surveys are tools of the current moment (not fortune tellers), and those tools have, on the whole, done a good job of forecasting Biden's and the Democratic Party's political fates over the past few years.  Let's start with the most recent election, when polling supposedly did poorly. It is true that some surveys underestimated Democratic candidates. The polls that meet CNN's standards for publication, however, were quite good. The national surveys looking at the generic congressional ballot had Republicans ahead by about 1.5 points over the last 21 days of the campaign. Republicans ended up winning the national House vote by a little less than 3 points. If you take out uncontested races -- more Republicans than Democrats were unopposed in House contests last year -- the final margin would probably have been closer to a 2-point Republican edge. An error of less than 2 points (or 1 point) is really good.The 2022 state-level polling was also above par. The average miss for gubernatorial elections was about 3 points, while it was less than 2.5 points in US Senate races. The previous average polling miss since 1998 had been above 5 points. Comparisons with 2020 pollingPolling in 2020, of course, consistently showed Biden ahead of Trump. While those polls were too friendly to Biden and Democrats, they accurately showed them winning the election that November. Multiple surveys since last year have shown Trump ahead of Biden in a potential 2024 election. Some polls also have Biden trailing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Over the entire 2020 campaign, not a single reputable poll found Trump ahead of Biden.Quite simply, the polling today looks nothing like it did when Biden won his first term. If anything, it looks considerably worse for him. The good news for Biden is that the general election is almost two years away, and the polling could change considerably. Even general election polls at this point are mostly within the margin of error, on average. With inflation calming and gas prices much lower than they were over much of last summer, you could easily see Biden's poll numbers improving. I would point out as well that Biden is probably in better shape than the surveys indicating Democrats don't want him running again would suggest. The simple reason is that politics doesn't happen in a vacuum. Unless it's a California recall election, most voters don't cast ballots saying ""yes"" or ""no"" to a single politician. They have to choose between different candidates. The limited polling that tests Biden against other Democrats for 2024 has him well ahead nationally. That may be part of the reason why no serious challengers to the president have emerged. Remember, it was this same national primary polling that was an early sign of Biden's strength in the 2020 Democratic primary. He maintained his lead for almost the entire primary process, even as a lot of people were willing to dismiss him. The bottom line is that I wouldn't count Biden out going into 2024. Beating an incumbent president isn't easy. The majority do win reelection when they run. Still, Biden's negative polling is most likely an accurate depiction of where the electorate stands right now.

113,South Dakota is set to ban nearly all forms of gender-affirming care for minors,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/us/south-dakota-ban-gender-affirming-treatment-minors/index.html,"The state Senate passed a House bill banning surgical and non-surgical gender-affirming treatment for minors on Thursday in a 30-4 vote, advancing the legislation to Gov. Kristi Noem's desk. Noem will sign the bill into law, a spokesperson for the Republican governor told CNN on Friday. The legislation bars puberty blocking medication in patients under the age of 18, as well as sex hormones and surgery related to gender transition.Opponents of the measure say it would be harmful to transgender children and is an intrusion by the government into medical decisions.""Surgeries-gone-wrong are simply not happening in South Dakota,"" said Democratic state Sen. Liz Larson while announcing her opposition. ""I don't know about you, but I don't need the state Legislature when I'm in the doctor's office.""Susan Williams, who heads of the transgender advocacy group Transformation Project Advocacy Network in South Dakota, decried the measure. ""Our community is sad. Our community is angry. Worst of all, our community is scared,"" Williams wrote in a post on her group's Facebook page. ""I feel betrayed by the elected officials who are supposed to protect my family that just voted against us.""State Sen. Tim Reed, a Republican, offered an amendment that would have removed the ban on puberty blockers, arguing some minors need them for reasons other than gender transition. But his amendment failed on a voice vote.""Puberty blockers can calm a child's anxiety so that counseling can begin,"" Reed said. ""Blockers have a place helping families navigate through an extremely difficult situation.""Supporters of the legislation say treatment for minors should be limited strictly to mental health counseling. Republican state Sen. Al Novstrup, a sponsor of the legislation, said, ""We care deeply about children who are struggling with their identities and want to provide them with true meaningful help, not permanent physical damage."" South Dakota is among several Republican-led states that have been proposing -- and advancing -- anti-trans measures in recent years. Last February, South Dakota became the first state to disallow transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at accredited schools and colleges. More recently, Utah passed a law last month that bans hormone treatment and surgical procedures for minors seeking gender-affirming care. "
114,Hong Kong raids shop suspected of selling cat and dog meat -- 70 years after trade was banned,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/asia/hong-kong-shop-investigation-cat-dog-meat-intl-hnk/index.html,"Officers seized ""suspected samples of dog or cat flesh"" at a shop in the Yau Ma Tei district during a ""joint blitz operation"" by the city's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department on Thursday evening.The AFCD said it had carried out the raid after receiving reports that the meats were on sale in Yau Ma Tei -- a densely populated commercial and residential district in the Kowloon area -- and that it had arranged testing of the seized samples.It said it was also investigating whether the shop was trading fresh meat without a license.""Prosecution will be instituted should it be proven,"" the AFCD said in a statement. Eating dog and cat meat has been prohibited in Hong Kong since 1950 under the semi-autonomous Chinese city's laws, and the news has prompted both lawmakers and animal welfare advocates to call for greater enforcement efforts.Lawmaker Gary Chan in a Facebook post described the sale of cat and dog meat as ""unacceptable.""""Hong Kong has outlawed the eating of cat and dog meat for over 70 years,"" the legislator said. ""The incident highlights that the frequency of spot checks by law enforcement agencies has not been enough.""The raid by the government agencies followed local media reports alleging the meats could be found on sale frozen for about $12 a catty (a local unit equivalent to about 1.3 pounds) -- similar to the price of cooked beef. Local rights group Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said on Friday it ""strongly condemns"" the selling of dog and cat meat for food.It urged the public to immediately contact the police and other relevant authorities if they suspect it is on sale.Hong Kong's Dogs and Cats Regulations stipulates that ""no person shall slaughter any dog or cat for use as food whether for mankind or otherwise, and no person shall sell or use or permit the sale or use of the flesh of dogs and cats for food."" Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $640 and six months' imprisonment.An estimated 30 million dogs and 10 million cats globally are slaughtered each year for human consumption, according to Humane Society International.

120,India tried to rebrand Valentine's Day as 'Hug a Cow Day.' Here's how it went,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/india/india-valentines-day-cow-hug-intl-hnk/index.html,"Indeed, so revered are the animals that authorities had planned to rebrand this Valentine's Day as ""Cow Hug Day"", hoping the move would both boost citizens' ""emotional richness"" and strike a blow for local heritage over what is seen as a western cultural import. But the move appears to have backfired and been abandoned after it prompted a flood of internet memes, cartoons and jokes by TV hosts about the importance of consent.The declaration of February 14 as ""Cow Hug Day,"" had come in a statement Monday from the Animal Welfare Board of India, which called cows the ""backbone of Indian culture and rural economy."" The cow is ""the giver of all, providing riches to humanity"" due to its ""nourishing nature,"" said the agency, a statutory body that advises India's Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying. It said the push to hug cows was part of an effort to promote ""Vedic"" or sacred Hindu traditions, which it claimed have been eroded by Western influence. ""Vedic traditions are almost on the verge of extinction due to the progress of (western) culture over time,"" the statement said. ""The dazzle of western civilization has made our physical culture and heritage almost forgotten."" But within a week of the announcement -- after days of mockery and ridicule online -- the idea appears to have been dropped.For days, media outlets have been mocking the government's plan, publishing satirical cartoons showing cows running away from amorous men, while internet users have delighted in posting videos of violent encounters between beast and man.An anchor on one of India's leading English-language news channels, NDTV, was even filmed attempting to hug several cows, which appeared to rebuke his advances. ""Consent is important,"" he joked during the segment. 'Cow science'This is not the first time the government has caused a stir with its policies towards cows -- the killing or eating of which is considered a sin by many Hindus, who account for about 80% of India's 1.3 billion people.The sale and slaughter of the animal is banned in much of the country and the animals are often left to roam free in the streets and roads looking emaciated, where motorists must take care to avoid hitting them.An agency for the protection of cows, known as the Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog (RKA), was set up in 2019 by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying.Two years later, the RKA was forced to indefinitely postpone a national ""cow science"" exam after the curriculum prompted widespread criticism over its unscientific claims about the animal. Among several unproven claims, the 54-page exam study guide stated that large-scale abattoir activity leads to major earthquakes, suggesting that pain emitted by mass slaughter could generate enough stress to trigger a seismic reaction. Without providing evidence, it also stated that native (Indian) cows produce the best quality of milk, compared to ""exotic cows.""A political animalFollowing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rise to power in 2014 on a wave of Hindu-nationalism, the animal has also become increasingly politicized.Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is strongly aligned with conservative Hindu traditions and critics say cow-worship has been used as a tool to intimidate, harass and even kill Muslims, who they accuse in some cases of disrespecting the animals.According to Human Rights Watch, cow vigilante crimes in India have been ignored or covered up by authorities since Modi took office.During Modi's 2014 election campaign, he promised to end a ""pink revolution"" -- a phrase he used to describe the slaughter of cattle.Other BJP lawmakers have taken it one step further.""I had promised that I will break the hands and legs of those who do not consider cows their mother and kill them,"" said Vikram Saini, a legislator for the state of Uttar Pradesh, at an event in March 2017.The statements led to outcry in the country where violence against women and minorities make frequent headlines. Critics say there is a double standard within the government, and argue the BJP isn't doing enough to protect vulnerable groups.In 2017, a photo series from photographer and activist Sujatro Ghosh portraying Indian women wearing cow masks went viral on social media. The series of images was intended to depict a society in which cows are more valued than women.Speaking to reporters about ""Hug a Cow Day"" on Thursday -- before it was cancelled -- BJP lawmaker Giriraj Singh said ""a very good decision has been taken"" by the government.""Cows should be hugged,"" he said. ""We should love and hug the cow."""
121,New Mexico State men's basketball program is suspended over hazing allegations,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/sport/new-mexico-state-aggies-men-basketball-hazing-suspended/index.html,"The coaching staff has been placed on paid administrative leave as the conduct among the Aggies is investigated, university officials said. ""The board supports the action taken by the university leaders and is confident a full and thorough investigation will be conducted,"" the NMSU Board of Regents said in a statement to CNN.Officials have not provided details on the allegations or how many students were involved. CNN has reached out to the campus and New Mexico police for comment. NMSU chancellor Dan E. Arvizu sent a letter to the school's community on Saturday that confirmed the indefinite suspension and called hazing a ""despicable act.""""The most important job I have as Chancellor of the NMSU System is to ensure our students are safe and protected from harm,"" Arvizu said. ""That's why I was so heartbroken and sickened to hear about these hazing allegations."" Hazing ""humiliates and degrades someone and has the potential to cause physical and emotional harm, or even death,"" he said. ""Sadly, hazing can become part of an organization's culture, if left unchecked. NMSU policy strictly prohibits hazing, in all forms, and it's something we simply will not tolerate.""The Aggies, who are 9-15 in head coach Greg Heiar's first season with the team, have already faced controversy this season.In November, NMSU basketball player Mike Peake was wounded in a fatal shooting on the University of New Mexico campus, authorities said. Peake was targeted by Brandon Travis, a 19-year-old UNM student, who was killed after exchanging gunfire with Peake, New Mexico State Police said in a news release.The basketball game between the two in-state rivals scheduled for that night was postponed as a result of the shooting.New Mexico State said in its statement that the new hazing allegations are ""separate from the events that took place"" at New Mexico. The Western Athletic Conference -- which includes the Aggies as a member -- told CNN in a statement that it is monitoring the situation and ""has no additional comment."""

124,What we know about the unidentified object shot down over Alaska,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/politics/unidentified-object-alaska-military-latest/index.html,"US military pilots sent up to examine the object gave conflicting accounts of what they saw, which is part of the reason why the Pentagon has been cautious in describing what the object actually is, according to a source briefed on the intelligence.The incident marked the second time that US jets had taken down an object in less than a week, following the shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina last week. On Saturday, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said it was monitoring ""a high altitude airborne object"" over northern Canada, and military aircraft are currently operating in the area from Alaska and Canada, according to a news release from the agency.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced shortly after that he ordered the downing of the object. It's currently not clear what this object is or whether it has any relation to the Chinese spy balloon or the object shot down over Alaska.Trudeau said he spoke with President Joe Biden on Saturday and that Canadian forces will lead the object recovery operation.The object taken down Friday, which officials have not characterized as a balloon, was shot down at 1:45 p.m. EST, according to Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, who said recovery teams are now collecting the debris that is sitting on top of ice in US territorial waters.The object ""came inside our territorial waters -- and those waters right now are frozen -- but inside territorial airspace and over territorial waters,"" National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told reporters on Friday. ""Fighter aircraft assigned to US Northern Command took down the object within last hour.""Asked about the operation on Friday afternoon, Biden told CNN, ""It was a success."" Here's a look at what we know so far about the object shot down on Friday.Many questions remainF-35 fighter jets were sent up to investigate after the object was first detected on Thursday, according to a US official. Kirby told reporters that the first fly-by of US fighter aircraft happened Thursday night, and the second happened Friday morning. Both brought back ""limited"" information about the object.But the pilots later gave differing reports of what they observed, the source briefed on the intelligence said.Some pilots said the object ""interfered with their sensors"" on the planes, but not all pilots reported experiencing that.Some pilots also claimed to have seen no identifiable propulsion on the object, and could not explain how it was staying in the air, despite the object cruising at an altitude of 40,000 feet.The conflicting eyewitness accounts are partly why the Pentagon has been unable to fully explain what the object is, the source briefed on the matter said. In a statement Saturday, US Northern Command said the command has no new information to share about the object's ""capabilities, purpose or origin,"" but noted that recovery efforts are being affected by Arctic weather conditions, ""including wind chill, snow and limited daylight."" The statement added that ""fighter aircraft"" downed the ""high altitude airborne object"" on Friday following an order from Biden and said recovery operations for the remains of the object continue Saturday in coordination with the FBI and local law enforcement. Kirby said Friday that Biden was first briefed on the object on Thursday evening, as ""soon as the Pentagon had enough information."" It ""did not appear to be self-maneuvering,"" Kirby said. It's unclear what the object looks like, or where it came from. On Friday, Ryder said it was traveling north east across Alaska. He declined to provide a physical characterization, only saying that it was ""about the size of a small car"" and ""not similar in size or shape"" to the Chinese surveillance balloon that was downed off the coast of South Carolina on February 4. ""We're calling this an object because that's the best description we have right now,"" Kirby said. ""We don't know who owns it -- whether it's state-owned or corporate-owned or privately-owned, we just don't know."" Object was a 'reasonable threat'There was not a significant concern about damage to people or property if the object was shot down, which was the primary reason the Chinese surveillance balloon was allowed to traverse the continental US last week. Ryder also emphasized that officials do not know the origin of the object, which did not appear to be manned and that it was shot down because it posed a ""reasonable threat to civilian air traffic"" as it was flying at 40,000 feet. Ultimately, the object was downed near the Canadian border and northeastern Alaska by a F-22 fighter jet out of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, equipped with an AIM-9X -- the same aircraft and missile used to take down the surveillance balloon. A US official said the military waited to shoot the object down during daylight hours to make it easier for the pilots to spot it. Ryder said the mission was ""supported with aerial assets from the Alaska Air National Guard."" The Alaska National Guard and units under US Northern Command, along with HC-130 Hercules, HH-60 Pave Hawk, and CH-47 Chinook are all participating in the effort to recover the object, Ryder said.No apparent connection to the Chinese balloonOfficials have given no indication so far that the object is at all related to the Chinese surveillance balloon downed last weekend, debris of which is still being recovered on the Atlantic Ocean floor. Ryder said Friday that recovery teams have ""mapped the debris field"" and are ""in the process of searching for and identifying debris on the ocean floor."" ""While I won't go into specifics due to classification reasons,"" Ryder said, ""I can say that we have located a significant amount of debris so far that will prove helpful to our further understanding of this balloon and its surveillance capabilities.""  When asked Friday if lessons learned about China's balloon assisted in detecting the object shot down over Alaska, Ryder said it was ""a little bit of apples and oranges."" The object did not appear to have any surveillance equipment, according to a US official, which would make it both smaller and likely less sophisticated than the Chinese balloon shot."

Among those at the committee hearing were Police Chief Cerelyn Davis and council members JB Smiley, Dr. Jeff Warren, Worth Morgan, Michalyn Easter-Thomas and Chase Carlisle.To highlight some of the danger of police stops, activists listed some of the people who had been harmed, including Anjustine Hunter, who was killed by police in 2013 after being pulled over for vehicle registration; Darrius Stewart, who was killed in 2015 after being pulled over for a headlight issue, and D'Mario Perkins, who died in 2018 after being pulled over for vehicle registration. According to CNN affiliate WMC, the Shelby county prosecutor in 2019 declined to file charges in Perkins' death after the medical examiner ruled his shooting a suicide. According to investigators, two officers opened fire at the traffic stop after Perkins fired his weapon, the station reported.Two others were reported to be wounded during traffic stops in 2018, and 2021, respectively.According to the group's analysis of traffic stops in Memphis using police data, Black male drivers in the city were disproportionately stopped by Memphis police officers, being cited 3.4 times more than White male drivers, while Black women were cited 4.7 times as often as White women in the city. The group said Black Memphians under 30 were cited six times as often as White Memphians under 30, also according to its analysis of police data The group argued that the action of pretextual stops were ""discriminatory,"" ""counterproductive"" and ""dangerous"" to residents of the city.""For a city that has the kind of traffic problems that we have, traffic enforcement is important. However, we do not want to enforce traffic from a standpoint of profiling any particular community, any particular group,"" the pollce chief said at the committee hearing in response to the data presented. ""We do live in a city that's predominately African American. We do live in a city that has problems in our African American community.""""We need to really look at how do we extract data and be very transparent about the activity of our officers on the road,"" Davis said.Unlike some other cities, Memphis does not publicize traffic enforcement data. Decarcerate Memphis said it collected its data from five years of tickets obtained from the department through public records requests.Five Black officers involved in Nichols' arrest are due to be arraigned February 17 after they were fired January 20, then indicted on seven counts each, including second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping and official misconduct. A sixth officer, who is White, was fired and disciplined for violating policies in the Nichols case, while a seventh officer who has not been publicly identified is on administrative leave and under investigation.Defense attorneys looking for Scorpion unit involvement in their casesThe SCORPION unit was created to tackle rising crime in the city. It was disbanded amid national outcry following Nichols' death, the department has said.Defense attorneys in Memphis are going through their cases, trying to see whether any of their clients had run-ins with members of the unit, according to lawyer Mike Working. The hope is that whatever legal jeopardy their clients faced or faces will crumble, just as the credibility of the unit has.  City officials have not released any roster of the specialized unit so attorneys are searching charging documents for mentions of the team's involvement. ""The tactics of the Scorpion unit were so brazen, and so many people have come forward that the entire unit is in question. And defense attorneys will ask for the chance to really review everything,"" Working said. Charges will not automatically be dismissed, but the presence of the unit now means that defense attorneys will be able to see discovery, like body cameras or dash cameras, as much as six months earlier than usual, he said. The ability to wade through evidence sooner could mean attorneys could find something to get their client's case thrown out, he added. ""Scorpion, by its name, means there's probably something there for the defense to investigate that must be disclosed,"" Working said. It's unclear how many criminal cases currently involve Scorpion unit officers, but after Tyre Nichols, it will be that much more difficult for prosecutors to build and maintain a case through trial, Working said. ""They worked in teams, most officers on the team participated in an arrest,"" he said. ""So if all the people are going to be on a Scorpion team, I think it could be hard for the [district attorney] to piece that case back together once it's been tainted by the Scorpion [unit]."""

In the same region, a 35-year-old survivor identified as Mustafa Sarıgül was freed from the ruins of a six-story apartment building after 149 hours.However, reports of these incredible rescues have slowed as the hours tick by since the quake.Concerns over security have also hampered some international search efforts.German rescue operations in Turkey, which were halted on Saturday due to security concerns, ""in general"" remain suspended for these reasons, the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) told CNN on Sunday.Israeli search-and-rescue group United Hatzalah also announced Sunday that it was leaving Turkey after six days on the ground due to a ""significant security threat.""United Hatzalah chief executive Eli Pollack and vice president of operations Dov Maisel said in a statement they had ""received intelligence of a concrete and immediate threat on the Israeli delegation and we have to put the security of our personnel first.""""We knew that there was a certain level of risk in sending our team to this area of Turkey, which is close to the Syrian border but we took the necessary steps in order to mitigate the threat for the sake of our lifesaving mission,"" Maisel said. Some international rescue efforts have resumed, however.The Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit (AFDRU) said a rescue dog handler was again helping Turkish rescue workers, with Turkish forces providing security in the search areas.Operations were suspended early on Saturday due to an ""increasingly difficult security situation,"" AFDRU said in a statement, adding there was ""increasing aggression between groups in Turkey."" Later in the day, Austrian Army spokesman Michael Bauer said on Twitter that teams had resumed operations.Since Tuesday, 82 AFDRU soldiers have been deployed; they are scheduled to leave on Thursday.The Palestinian Red Crescent said Sunday that it was the first group to send a team to provide mental health support to earthquake victims in Syrian shelters.""Among the tens of thousands of victims of the devastating earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria, hundreds of children are languishing in hospitals and shelters without their families and homes,"" read a statement issued by the group.""Difficult times have been experienced by children since the earthquake. Some of them miraculously escaped death, but after their physical survival, psychological support teams of the Palestinian Red Crescent are working for their psychological survival,"" the statement continued.The group's Psychosocial Support Team arranged events and activities for those in the shelters, including games for children.The team of Palestinians along with local volunteers is also providing mental health services to about 300 children and their families in shelters and hospitals, who are suffering from severe trauma and depression as a result of the earthquake."
128,US says it killed 12 al-Shabaab fighters in Somalia airstrike,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/politics/us-somalia-airstrike-al-shabaab/index.html,"No civilians were injured or killed, AFRICOM said in a statement Sunday, given the remote location of the strike, about 472 kilometers northeast of the Somali capital of Mogadishu.""Rooting out extremism requires intervention beyond traditional military means,"" the command said. The US has provided ongoing support to the Somali government since President Joe Biden last year approved a Pentagon request to redeploy US troops the area in an attempt to counter the al-Shabaab terrorist group. The approval to send fewer than 500 troops was a reversal of former President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw all US troops from the country in 2020.In recent months, US forces have conducted numerous strikes in the region that have resulted in dozens of al-Shabaab casualties.Last month, the US carried out a strike in Somalia that killed approximately 30 al-Shabaab fighters, AFRICOM said. A US strike in October killed two members of the terrorist group and a subsequent November strike killed 17 fighters. And in late December, a US strike killed six al-Shabaab militants near the city of Cadale."
129,'Just to survive': Wagner fighters recount the horrors of battle in eastern Ukraine,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/europe/wagner-convicts-eastern-ukraine-pleitgen-intl/index.html,"The two fighters were captured by Ukrainian forces late last year. CNN is not disclosing their identities for their own safety. Both are married with children and were recruited while in prison. One was serving a 20-year sentence for manslaughter. For security reasons, the Ukrainians kept a presence in the room where the interview took place. CNN told the fighters that they could end the interview at any time they wished. But they spoke in detail for more than an hour.   The two fighters told of hideous losses in ""first wave"" assaults reminiscent of World War I charges.""There were 90 of us. Sixty died in that first assault, killed by mortar fire. A handful remained wounded,"" said one, recalling his first assault near the village of Bilohorivka. ""If one group is unsuccessful, another is sent right away. If the second one is unsuccessful, they send another group."" The other fighter was involved in an assault lasting five days, through a forest near the city of Lysychansk on the Luhansk-Donetsk border in eastern Ukraine.""The first steps into the forest were difficult because of all the landmines spread out. Out of 10 guys, seven were killed immediately,"" he said.  ""You can't help the wounded. The Ukrainians were firing heavily on us, so even if their wounds were minor, you've got to keep going, otherwise you're the one getting hit by the fire. ""You are at it for five days, people dying right next to me, praying to God, begging for water. You think that you can put down your weapon and nothing else will happen. And then the fight starts again 10 minutes later, and [the Ukrainians] keep coming after you. There is no feeling attached to it. Just wave after wave."" ""Four hundred [Wagner fighters] were brought there, and then more and more, all the time.""   The prisoner said a self-preservation instinct had kicked in for him, but others froze. ""Some stop right there in the forest and drop their weapons. But to drop your weapons is to come under sniper fire and die."" There was no evacuation of the wounded, he added. ""If you're wounded, you roll away on your own at first, any way you can, somewhere neutral where there's no fire, and if there's no one around, you administer first aid to yourself,"" he said. Casualties piled up by the dozen, the men said. ""When the casualties arrive, you get orders to load them, and you don't really think who's dead and who's wounded,"" one of the fighters said. Throughout their several weeks on the front lines, the two men said they had only one instinct.   ""Just to survive. I just had the desire to survive, no matter what the cost,"" said the prisoner involved in the forest attack.They became numb to the casualties and the killing of the Ukrainian soldiers they faced. ""You'd think you'd feel something [after killing someone], but no, you just keep going.""The alternative to walking through minefields towards Ukrainian artillery was just as lethal, according to the men's accounts.  ""We couldn't retreat without orders because if we don't comply with the order, we will be killed,"" said one of the prisoners. ""One man stayed at a position, he was really scared, it was his first assault. We received an order to run forward. But the man hid under a tree and refused. This was reported to the command and that was it. He was taken 50 meters away from the base. He was digging his own grave and then was shot."" The other fighter reported a similar situation: ""Our commander was told that if anyone gets cold feet, he would have to be eliminated. And if we failed to eliminate him, we would be eliminated for failing to eliminate him.""   The promise of freedom The two men described how they were recruited by Wagner. In August and September last year, the group's chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, arrived by helicopter at the prisons where they were held, offering six-month contracts in return for being pardoned.  One of the men still had 10 years of jail time ahead after a manslaughter conviction.  ""I weighed that six months was better than the 10 or 11 years I could still spend in prison... I just wanted a fresh start in life,"" he said.  At the time, Prigozhin's recruitment campaign in Russia's prisons was in full swing. It's estimated by Western intelligence officials and prison advocacy groups that between 40,000 and 50,000 men were recruited. On Thursday, Prigozhin said the prison recruitment drive was over but gave no reason.  ""Only a handful in my unit came for money, most came because they had long sentences,"" said one of the fighters. ""But there were also some who had only 12 days of their sentence remaining, and they went anyway.  ""They lined everyone up in the yard and Prigozhin started recruiting people,"" he said. ""[Prigozhin] said he had the authority from higher-up bodies to take anyone from the prison, regardless of the crimes or the prison term. The ideal candidates are murderers, robbers.""  The selection process was so rudimentary that older prisoners only had to show they could march a few yards, one of the prisoners said. ""They took almost everyone."" ""Some of them were head cases ... the crazy ones, the ones who when they get a weapon in their hands they wouldn't know how to handle it,"" he added.For prison inmates with years to serve, the offer was tempting.  One of the prisoners said: ""For our freedom we had to fight for six months in Ukraine, to fight the Nazis. At the same time, he promised us wages, repayment of loans, and a clean history."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pushed the groundless rhetoric of ""denazification"" as justification for his invasion of Ukraine.  Soon after Prigozhin's visits, hundreds of prisoners were taken by bus and plane to a training ground in the Rostov region of Russia, according to the two men. There was a strict ban on drugs and alcohol, one of the prisoners said. Some of the commanders said they had fought for Wagner in Africa and Syria.   The training was brief and basic -- handling guns for the terrible assaults they would soon be ordered to carry out. The men said it was clear they were being prepared for missions they'd not signed up for. Now they are bitter about the deceptions in Prigozhin's sales pitch.  ""He did not mention anything about danger,"" one said. ""He talked about expunging all convictions, we would serve six months, all convictions would be expunged, an advance payment of 240,000 roubles (around $3,300) and also that our task was to hold the defense on the second line.""  The two men also feel deceived about the nature of the conflict.  ""We thought we'd be fighting Poles and various mercenaries. Germans. We didn't think anyone was left in the Ukrainian army there. We thought they'd left the country,"" said one.  ""So it became clear they were just spinning lies to get us to enter into battle with the Ukrainians. No one really thought that the AFU [Armed Forces of Ukraine] would actually fight for their own country, for their loved ones. We only learned this after going in there.""It was almost a relief to be captured, the prisoners said.   One said he and a wounded comrade were the only survivors in his group, caught ""between two Ukrainian mortars and a sniper.""""The command ordered me to dig in at my position, so I dug in at my position, awaiting evacuation. They sent one group of 10, and the sniper eliminated all 10,"" he recalled. ""Then the command told us on the walkie-talkie: Get out any way you can, you're on your own."" It was then, he said, that Ukrainian soldiers ""came up and fired a shot next to my foot, said 'hands up,' and that was it.""  When asked if they would make the same decision again, the prisoners paused for a moment.  ""I think it was the wrong choice... I'd never participated in any military operation, especially fighting against the AFU, which refuses to give up its land. They brought us here under the wrong pretext. And so we are at war, but I don't think it's a just cause,"" said one.  The other prisoner agreed. ""I don't think it was worth it. Now I am hoping I can turn over a new leaf.""   He said he had managed to reach his family since being taken prisoner.   ""They thought that I was dead, until I had contacted them. They cried and were surprised that I was alive.""  Both men said they wanted to return to Russia.  Said one, ""I don't care about Russia, but I just want to go home."""

Vinicius, Benzema, Valverde ... they have done very well. They showed skills and quality. It was great.""Though the score was 2-1 at the break -- Vinicius Jr and Valverde putting the Spaniards 2-0 up before Moussa Marega scored for Al Hilal -- Real was the dominant side at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium.Real was in control throughout the match, dominating possession and having 11 shots on target to Al Hilal's three, but the defense was, at times, exposed, with Marega and Luciano Vietto causing Real's defenders problems. Fans were treated to a high-scoring, entertaining encounter. Vinicius Jr set up Benzema to make it 3-1 before Valverde extended Real's lead. Vietto halved the deficit, and fired in a second in the 79th minute, but Real never looked in danger of slipping up. Victory for Real means European teams have won the past 10 editions of the tournament, while Real now has a combined total of eight global titles, winning three Intercontinental Cup trophies, a predecessor to the Club World Cup. The next most successful sides are AC Milan and Bayern Munich with four titles each in the two competitions."

The charges were submitted to the City of Scottsdale Prosecutor's Office, which handles misdemeanor cases.Cody Blackbird, who told CNN he has been performing for 15 years and is of Dakota and Eastern Band of Cherokee descent, recorded the interaction on his phone.  In the video, which has been seen widely on social media, Ortega can be seen standing in front of his shop apparently mocking Native American chants and pretending to hit a drum.Someone in the crowd then yells, ""Can you get out of here?"" before Ortega yells, ""MAGA country! MAGA country!""""He was mocking our chanting and then said something in Navajo that's so taboo, some people won't even translate it,"" Blackbird said. Someone in Blackbird's party responded with ""step into the street"" before Ortega walked up to the group and then is pulled away by a woman who takes him back into the store.According to Blackbird, Ortega had been yelling racist insults at the group for a few minutes before he decided to record the interaction. Blackbird, who lives in Casa Grande, Arizona, said he has never had an interaction with Ortega before Tuesday.Ortega gave a statement to CNN affiliate KTVK/KPHO, saying that he was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" by his actions.""I have watched the video and ... I see that I came off as incredibly insensitive toward the Native American community and that was not my intention. I deeply apologize for this,"" Ortega said in the statement, according to KTVK/KPHO.The statement added: ""My family has traded with the Native Americans for over 5 generations, and I continue to do so to this day. I grew up with the Navajo and Zuni cultures in Gallup, NM. So, I have always had the deepest respect and admiration for Native Americans and their ingenuity. Again, I apologize for my actions, and if I could go back and change my words and behavior, I certainly would,"" according to KTVK/KPHO.CNN has reached out to Ortega for comment. An informational page on his gallery website says his family ""has been trading with the Native American community since the early 1800's"" and features Native American art and jewelry for purchase. City officials condemn incidentBlackbird said the group initially was inside another shop located across the street when an ESPN film crew asked if they could perform outside, where the network is hosting a Super Bowl event.""We were filming inside the Native Art Market and then ESPN suggested we move outside and get a shot in front of the Super Bowl sign, and that's when Gilbert came out of this store and started spouting his racist rhetoric,"" Blackbird said.Heather Tracy, co-owner of the Native Art Market, told CNN that Ortega started harassing the performers when they were on the street making their way over to the Super Bowl sign with the ESPN film crew. ESPN declined to provide a statement when reached for comment, citing the police matter. Blackbird said Ortega approached him and the owners of the Native Art Market on Wednesday and tried to apologize, but Blackbird feels it's not enough.No one called police to the scene, Blackbird told CNN, but he says he was later contacted by Scottsdale police, who asked if he wanted to file a report. The Scottsdale Police Department did not indicate in its statement how it was notified of the incident.Kelly Corsette, a spokesperson for the City of Scottsdale, told CNN the city condemns what happened outside the gallery.""Scottsdale prides itself as a welcoming community for all people. We are sad that this incident occurred and offer our full support to those who were targeted. The city condemns this individual's racist comments -- they do not represent our community,"" Corsette said.Scottsdale Mayor David D. Ortega -- no relation to Gilbert Ortega -- released a statement following the incident, saying the ""despicable language and rage directed to Native performers is reprehensible and inexcusable.""""Two years ago, when Native Art Market opened in Old Town, I welcomed them wholeheartedly to our community. Today I met in person with them to express solidarity and assure them that the City of Scottsdale is pursuing the matter to the fullest extent of the law,"" the statement added."

Accounts from that day differ, but witnesses alleged Emmett whistled at Bryant (now Donham) at the market she owned with her husband in Money, Mississippi.Later, her husband, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, took Till from his bed and ordered him into the back of a pickup truck and beat him before shooting him in the head and tossing his body into the Tallahatchie River. They were both acquitted of murder following a trial in which Carolyn Bryant testified that Emmett grabbed and verbally threatened her.In 2007, a Mississippi grand jury declined to indict Donham on any charges. ""It was Carolyn Bryant's lie that sent Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam into a rage, which resulted in the mutilation of Emmett Till's body into a [sic] unrecognizable condition,"" the newly filed lawsuit states.""The Leflore County Sheriff is complicit in the trio's escape from justice even though both Roy Bryant and J.W.

Furthermore, suspects hurled explosive devices and rocks at the forces.""We are aware of the reports regarding a number of armed individuals who got injured during the exchange of fire,"" the Israeli statement said.A video from Jenin on Sunday showed what appeared to be at least seven Israeli military vehicles entering the city, and another showed smoke rising from behind a multi-story building.

The gunmen handed the body over to Palestinian Authority security officials the following day. The IDF said there had been no negotiations and no exchange for Ferro's remains.Zubeidi had previously served 11 years in an Israeli prison, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said.

Cities under this risk include Tallahassee, Gainesville and Jacksonville. There is also a Level 1 threat for Tampa, Orlando, and Spring Hill, Florida.""Winds will also be a concern given the strength of the low pressure system, the National Weather Service Office in Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina, said. ""There`s also the potential for gravity waves to help force stronger winds to the surface.""Gusty winds are expected along the spine of the southern and central Appalachians which could reach as high as 40 mph.In addition to the severe threat, a Level 2 out of 4 risk for excessive rainfall has been posted across portions of northern Florida, southeast Georgia, and South Carolina. Flooding is possible from Birmingham, Alabama, to Wilmington, North Carolina, down to Gainesville, Florida. Widespread rainfall totals through Sunday are expected to be between 2 and 3 inches, but some locally higher amounts of 4 to 6 inches are possible across northern Florida, including Tallahassee, and southern Georgia, including Valdosta. Many southern cities, including Tallahassee and Atlanta, will be at risk for flooding due to the ground already being saturated because of recent rains and a wet start to the year.Since January, Atlanta and Macon in Georgia, and Columbia in South Carolina have all had a surplus of 2 to 4 inches of rain. This will allow for saturation and water run-off to occur more quickly than under normal conditions.Snow for the southern Appalachians""By Saturday night into Sunday morning, heavy wet snow and/or sleet are expected to develop near/over the central and southern Appalachians when the low pressure system is forecast to further intensify and track near the Carolina coastline,"" the prediction center said. Winter weather alerts are in effect for portions of western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, western Virginia and eastern Kentucky through Sunday. Snow accumulation will be generally up to 4 inches but highest elevations, such as Mount Mitchell in North Carolina, have the potential to see up to a foot.Some snow flurries will mix in with rainfall in the lower elevations, though accumulations are expected to remain light.""There continues to be good agreement on rain changing to snow across the mountains,"" the Greenville-Spartanburg office said. ""There even appears to be the potential for a brief period of snow outside of the mountains late Saturday night/early Sunday morning. The North Carolina Foothills would be in a transition zone where some accumulating snow is possible.""The weather service office also emphasizes that while this set up can be good for wintry precipitation, the lack of cold air to start the weekend is the limiting factor. In other words, the snow forecast is uncertain, but the potential is there.Snow isn't the only concern for the region -- ice may lead to travel hazards through the weekend as well.""[We] will also have mixed winter precipitation, with some light freezing rain and sleet adding to the travel impact but lessening the potential snow totals,"" the National Weather Service office in Blacksburg, Virginia, said.Even places as far south as Georgia could see some snow, although don't get your hopes up for any of it to stick to the ground. ""It is becoming more and more likely that portions of North Georgia will see a mix of rain and melting snow throughout Sunday morning,"" the National Weather Service office in Atlanta said. ""It's possible that falling snow could be thick at times, however, with surface temperatures in the mid to upper 30s there may be a big difference in the amount of snow that FALLS, and the amount of snow that STICKS as accumulations could quickly melt."""

On May 4, 1917, during one of the biggest battles of the war, the French army was firing on German soldiers with heavy artillery. An artillery shell hit the entrance of the Winterberg tunnel on the Chemin des Dames, according to the Volksbund.Some of the German troops, from the 111th Baden Reserve Infantry Regiment, fled further into the tunnel, where stored ammunition had exploded and toxic fumes were being released.The soldiers created a barricade to try to protect themselves from the poisonous gases until they could be rescued, but heavy shelling prevented help from reaching them.The tunnel's entrance collapsed during the attack and just three soldiers out of an infantry of more than 200 were saved. The others suffocated, died of thirst or shot themselves.Over the years, there had been numerous -- including illegal --  attempts to find the buried tunnel entrance in the state forest of Vauclair, according to the Volksbund.Last May, more than a century after the event and following years of work, the Volksbund and French partners used precise drilling to confirm the tunnel's location, discovering a large cavity deep underground, with the burial site intact.By designating the site a memorial, German and French authorities hope to dignify and protect the soldiers' resting place. ""This guarantees that the soldiers will continue to rest in peace,"" said a Volksbund spokeswoman.""In the past years and months we have been cooperating with our French partners in a spirit of trust,"" said Dirk Backen, chief executive of the Volksbund.""We are very grateful for this -- and are pleased to be able to present a joint solution today,"" he added.Once the legal requirements for a war cemetery site are met, planning for the memorial site will begin, and the site could be inaugurated as early as next year, French and German officials said.

Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona independent.""Kyrsten Sinema as she was walking by, the senator from Arizona, she said something to the effect of 'hang in there buddy' or something like that,"" Santos told Newsmax. ""I said 'Thank you, madam senator,'"" Santos said during the interview. ""She was very polite, very kind-hearted as I've learned to see her. She's a good person, unlike Mr. Romney."" Sinema's office made clear on Friday there is no truth to that claim.""This is a lie,"" Sinema spokeswoman Hannah Hurley told CNN.Footage from that night shows Sinema walking in front of Romney as the Utah Republican passes by Santos. Santos appears to turn and speak to Sinema while Romney is talking. While Sinema turned to Santos, the senator's spokeswoman said her boss and the congressman didn't speak.Romney, on the other hand, didn't hold back when he saw Santos.""You don't belong here,"" he told Santos on the floor. He later confirmed the exchange and attacked the New York freshman over his litany of lies, telling reporters that Santos should resign from Congress if he ""had any shame at all."" Romney also bashed Santos' decision to stand in the center aisle where he would get maximum exposure on television during President Joe Biden's address to Congress.""He should be sitting in the back row and staying quiet instead of parading in front of the president and people coming into the room,"" Romney told reporters.Speaking to reporters the next day, Santos attacked Romney.""I think it's reprehensible that the senator would say such a thing to me in the demeaning way he said,"" Santos said. ""It wasn't very Mormon of him.""Romney declined to respond.""I don't have any comment on that,"" Romney told CNN on Thursday. ""I've said all I'm going to say on the topic.""Santos faces multiple investigations over his finances and repeated lies about his resume and biography. Federal investigators are examining his finances and the New York freshman is expected to face an investigation from the House Ethics Committee.

They filed a lawsuit seeking reinstatement to their former positions or equivalent positions, as well as reinstatement of lost fringe benefits and seniority rights. In a filing on Friday, both parties asked the Texas Supreme Court to defer consideration on the case to allow the parties to finalize and fund a settlement agreement. The filing included the mediated agreement which says that Paxton's office will pay $3.3 million and that the final settlement will say Paxton accepts that the former aides were acting in a manner they thought was right and apologizes for referring to them as ""rogue employees."" Paxton also agreed to remove the 2020 press release from his office's website in which he described his aides as ""rogue."" The press release has already been removed, and the filing says the settlement is contingent on all necessary approvals for funding.  Despite the apology, the formal settlement agreement does not contain an admission of liability or fault by any party.In a statement on Friday, Paxton acknowledged the settlement, explaining why he agreed to ""put this issue to rest"" but did not mention the apology portion of the agreement. ""After over two years of litigating with four ex-staffers who accused me in October 2020 of 'potential' wrongdoing, I have reached a settlement agreement to put this issue to rest. I have chosen this path to save taxpayer dollars and ensure my third term as Attorney General is unburdened by unnecessary distractions. This settlement achieves these goals. I look forward to serving the People of Texas for the next four years free from this unfortunate sideshow.""Lawyers for three of the plaintiffs also issued a statement to CNN, saying: ""Our clients have spent more than two years fighting for what is right. We believe the terms of the settlement speak for themselves.""Former Texas deputy attorneys general James Blake Brickman, Mark Penley, and Ryan Vassar -- along with former director of law enforcement David Maxwell -- were the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.CNN has previously reported that Paxton is facing an FBI investigation for abuse of office. He is also under indictment for securities fraud in a separate, unrelated case. Paxton has denied all charges and allegations.The former senior staff members largely stayed out of the limelight after filing the suit, but they broke their silence early last year ahead of the GOP primary, when Paxton was seeking the Republican nomination to be reelected as attorney general. They issued a statement responding to public comments that Paxton had made about the lawsuit during his reelection campaign.Paxton was reelected as attorney general in November.

140,Spain will offer citizenship to freed political prisoners from Nicaragua,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/europe/spain-nicaragua-political-prisoners-intl-latam/index.html,"The spokesman did not immediately respond to a CNN question regarding the details of the offer, including how quickly they could receive citizenship. The spokesman spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing local professional norms. Questions have mounted on the fate of the more than 200 new arrivals to the US, who were also stripped of their Nicaraguan citizenship on Thursday.Their release followed years of repression by the Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega. The authoritarian leader has jailed dozens of opposition figures and activists, particularly in the lead up to the last elections in November of 2021.US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday that the individuals, who all flew to Dulles International airport in Washington, will be granted humanitarian parole for two years, allowing them to remain US and giving them the time to apply for asylum if they wish.Each of the individuals who left Nicaragua ""voluntarily consented to travel,"" and ""there were two individuals who, on their own volition, chose not to travel to the United States,"" Price said.Among the released prisoners is one American, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who welcomed their move, calling it a product of American diplomacy.Ortega on Thursday said their release was not negotiated with Washington. ""We just wanted them to go,"" Ortega said.After calling the release of the prisoners ""a message for peace and stability for Nicaragua,"" the 77-year-old leader said the original list of those to be released contained 228 names, but the US had vetoed at least four prisoners because they had been convicted of common crimes.Bishop Rolando Alvarez, a high-profile member of the Catholic Church who has long opposed the Ortega regime and was detained in August 2022, was also due to be released, but he refused, Ortega said. Instead, 11 members of the clergy were released on Thursday morning.The political prisoners were greeted by US officials, activists and members of the Nicaraguan diaspora at Dulles airport. One of the arrivals was political activist Felix Maradiaga, who told CNN en Espanol that they only realized what was happening when by the plane.""They made us sign some documents saying in one single line that we were leaving the country of our free will with no further explanation,"" he said. ""On one side what happened is shocking, but on the other, I'm overwhelmed by this moment, the opportunity to hug our family. Personally, I haven't seen my daughter in more than three years."""
141,New Zealand braces for its most intense tropical cyclone since the 1990s,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/weather/new-zealand-tropical-cyclone-flooding-intl/index.html,"On January 27th, 240 mm (9.44 inches) of rain fell in Auckland, the country's largest city. That marked the most rainfall the city had ever seen in a day, and it was the equivalent of their entire summer's worth of rain.Now, a new threat is set to bring ferocious winds and devastating rains to Auckland and the North Island.The New Zealand MetService is forecasting that Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle is likely to impact the northern parts of New Zealand on Sunday and continue through Tuesday.""Those areas that are already vulnerable following last week's weather are expected to see more rain, strong wind, heavy swells and coastal inundation which will exacerbate the situation,"" said Lisa Murray, Head of Weather Communication at MetService. ""If the cyclone continues on its current path towards the north of Aotearoa New Zealand, we can expect this to be an extreme weather event with widespread damage.""Gabrielle is currently the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 140 kph (85 mph) as it churns over the Coral Sea, a few hundred kilometers off the Queensland coast of Australia. While it will likely weaken a little more before making landfall, the mountanous terrain can rapidly increase wind speeds and rainfall. ""This is the most intense tropical storm that we've seen threaten the northern part of New Zealand since the 1990s,"" Philip Duncan, head forecaster at New Zealand-based Weather Watch, tells CNN.While the storm may also lose its tropical characteristics and become a post-tropical system, it is not expected to lose its punch.""We're expecting 100 to 300 mm [of rainfall] for many parts of the North Island's north and eastern sides, with even greater totals if Gabrielle stalls or slows down,"" Duncan said. ""This rain will cause more slips/landslides, road closures, flight cancellations and possibly damage more homes as we saw in January.""Heavy rain watches have been issued for northern New Zealand starting on Sunday as Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle approaches with the threat of heavy rain and high wind gusts. Another heavy rain watch has also been issued for the Coromandel Peninsula and for Gisborne, where rainfall totals of 200 mm to 400 mm or more are possible. ""The duration of the event and the amount of rain forecast is highly dependent on the track of Cyclone Gabrielle, and this Watch could be upgraded to an Orange or possibly Red warning in the coming days,"" warns the New Zealand MetService. High wind watches have also been issued for most of the North Island of New Zealand.Winds are likely to gust over 100 kph (62 mph) and could reach 150 kph (93 mph) in the higher terrain and along the immediate coastline.  Conditions are expected to begin deteriorating Sunday and the worst of the storm should impact the country from Monday into Tuesday, local time.""Don't forget a cyclone brings severe damaging wind as well as heavy rain and swell,"" Murray said.  ""As the ground is already sodden, trees are more likely to topple, which could cause power outages.""  Along with wind and rain, there will also be heavy swells along the coastline for eastern areas and a storm surge of close to half a meter on top of that. Tropical Cyclone Gita impacted the South Island in 2018,  which was rare because of how far south it moved, according to Duncan.  However, that storm only impacted around 100,000 to 150,000 people while Gabrielle poses a threat to around 2.5 million.  Duncan says the last major cyclone event to affect northern New Zealand was during the 1996-97 cyclone season with Cyclones Fergus and Drena."

143,"New cars are crazy expensive but, if you're careful, they don't have to be",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/business/cheap-cars/index.html,"Two decades of historic data from auto website Edmunds.com indicates that options are the biggest driver in rising vehicle prices — and that it's been happening over many years.""Overall, the average price gap between base models and vehicles as optioned up by customers has soared, rising from 24.6% in 2002 to 38.1% in 2022."" The average sticker price of a new vehicle, as purchased, was about $30,000 in 2009 and reached almost $40,000 in 2019, before Covid hampered parts supply and vehicle production, according to Edmunds. Last year that figure reached almost $46,000, according to data from Edmunds.com.Yet the average sticker for base models, adjusted for inflation, has actually gone down a little — even as consumers have shifted from sedans to more expensive SUVs. The difference is the cost of options buyers added on.Steve Reed, an economist with Bureau of Labor Statistics, a government agency that measures inflation, concurred with what Edmunds' historic pricing data indicated.""According to our measures, the real cost of cars relative to other things has declined,"" he said.That's good news for drivers willing to go no-frills: If you don't want to pay lots of a new car, you don't have to. Don't dip heavily into the options list, and cars are actually relatively cheap.Base isn't so basic anymoreConsider the Nissan Versa, the cheapest car available for the 2023 model year.It has a base price of $15,730. Adjusted for inflation, that's barely different from the base price of a Hyundai Accent in 2002, the cheapest new car available that year. This is despite the fact the 2023 Versa is loaded with standard features — including push-button start, blind spot monitoring and a touchscreen — of which many weren't even available two decades ago. For lots of different types of vehicles, gaps between the lowest base price and the average sticker price as sold to customers have grown over the past two decades, according to Edmunds.com data.For the Mercedes E-class, for example, the difference between the base sticker price and the average sticker with options was just 11.5% in 2002 compared to 30% in 2022; for the Chevrolet Tahoe, it jumped from 14% to 41% over that same period; and for the Acura MDX it increased from 7% to 21%.Overall, the average price gap between base models and vehicles as optioned up by customers rose from 24.6% in 2002 to 38.1% in 2022. (Of course, it's not entirely surprising that base prices of vehicles haven't gone up in the past couple of decades, adjusted for inflation, since that is what ""adjusted for inflation"" is supposed to mean. New cars are part of the overall inflation picture for economists who calculate it,  accounting for a certain amount of improved quality.Competition is a factor, too. Car companies have found ways to keep prices down even while adding more safety technology and comfort features like standard automatic transmissions.These base price models may not make much money, if any, for automakers. But they can attract shoppers who can then be up-sold to more expensive versions in what's known as a ""loss leader"" pricing strategy, said Michael Brisson, director of economic strategy at Moodys.  And customers are more than willing to play along, said  Matt Jones, a spokesperson for the auto pricing site TrueCar who spent 12 years working at auto dealerships. ""The idea that people buy the most cost-effective thing? I have almost never seen that be the case,"" he said.It's up to youSo, even though vehicle shoppers are getting more for their money to start with, Americans keep piling on options.For General Motors' GMC brand, for example, the gap between base models and the average vehicle with options (as sold to customers) has been growing steadily among trucks and SUVs for the last 20 years.Surprisingly, the gap has been growing fastest in GMC's heavy-duty trucks, usually thought of as serious work vehicles. The average price of a GMC Sierra 2500 HD, as sold, is now double the base price.These customers see their big trucks as a reward for years of hard work, said Patrick Finnegan, head of marketing for GMC.""You may think a heavy-duty truck customer might not be in the market for that sort of thing, might not be willing to pay for it,"" said Finnegan. ""But it's some of those features that they're actually most excited about, like Bose Premium Series speakers.""Offering increasingly luxurious option packages is  a way for automakers to take advantage of greater income disparity in the United States, said University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers. Wealthy buyers can pay more while automakers maintain purchase opportunities for those without as much to spend. Pressure to upgradeA different kind of competitive pressure has resulted in this rise in options, said Edmunds.com's Drury: the competition with friends and neighbors who have the latest features on their cars. Plus, when buying a new vehicle, people seldom want less than they had before.Industry strategy also plays into it. Car shoppers can rarely pick and choose options individually.

145,Opinion: Balloons aren't the only strange objects flying in US airspace,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/opinions/china-military-ufo-shoot-down-spy-balloon-bergen/index.html,"The US military on February 4 shot down a Chinese spy balloon (which Beijing said was a weather balloon), followed by the downing of two unidentified flying objects on Friday and Saturday in US and Canadian airspace, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABC were likely also balloons.Then on Sunday, the US military shot down a fourth flying object, this time over Lake Huron in Michigan.In the wake of those actions, the report by America's intelligence community is worth examining since it may shed some light on what is happening here.January's UFO report had a striking finding: The number of UFO sightings significantly increased between March 2021 and August 2022, during which time 247 new sightings were reported, mostly by US Navy and Air Force pilots and personnel. That's almost double the 144 UFO sightings reported in the 17-year period between 2004 to 2021. The report suggested that the increase may be because there is less ""stigma"" associated with reporting UFO sightings, now that the Pentagon is actively pushing service personnel to report any ""anomalies"" seen in the sky.Indeed, in July, the Pentagon established a new entity, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, to investigate credible sightings of UFOs by the US military and intelligence community. This is part of a relatively new push by Congress and the Pentagon to make sense of more than 500 credible UFO sightings over the past couple of decades. The report by the US intelligence community found that a large number of those sightings, 163, were balloons or ""balloon-like entities,"" while 26 were unmanned aircraft systems, i.e., drones. An unspecified number of sightings were ""attributable to sensor irregularities or variances, such as operator or equipment error."" There were 171 unidentified object sightings, however, for which no explanation was found, and some of those objects ""demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities.""The report also noted that UFO sightings ""continue to occur in restricted or sensitive airspace, highlighting possible concerns for safety of flight."" It added that the sightings could point to ""adversary collection activity,"" suggesting that UFOs found around sensitive US military installations could be a foreign power spying on them.There is undoubtedly much more to learn about those 171 UFO sightings, which still have no good explanations. Are they the work of a foreign power probing US air defenses? Are they relatively innocuous, such as errant balloons? Congress should convene hearings to get to the bottom of this. The public has a right to understand why objects are flying around in American airspace that the Pentagon and the US intelligence community can't identify. "
146,US military shoots down high-altitude object over Lake Huron on Sunday,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/politics/lake-huron-high-altitude-object/index.html,"Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the object was not assessed to be a military threat, but it was a flight hazard.""We did not assess it to be a kinetic military threat to anything on the ground, but assess it was a safety flight hazard and a threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities. Our team will now work to recover the object in an effort to learn more,"" Ryder said. Melissa Dalton, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Hemispheric Affairs, echoed that sentiment Sunday night, telling reporters the objects were taken down out of an ""abundance of caution.""""In light of the People's Republic of China balloon that we took down last Saturday, we have been more closely scrutinizing our airspace at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase in objects that we detected over the past week,"" Dalton said, referring to a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina last weekend.She added that high-altitude objects can be used by a range of companies, countries, and research organizations for ""purposes that are not nefarious, including legitimate research.""The operation marks the third day in a row that an unidentified object was shot down over North American airspace. An unidentified object was shot down over northern Canada on Saturday. On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace by a US F-22. ""The spy balloon from the PRC was of course different in that we knew precisely what was,"" Dalton said. ""These most recent objects do not pose a kinetic military threat, but their path in proximity to sensitive DoD sites and the altitude that they were flying could be a hazard to civilian aviation and thus raised concerns.""Ryder said the object shot down Sunday was the same one that radar detected on Saturday over Montana that caused airspace to briefly close in the evening. ""North American Aerospace Defense Command detected the object Sunday morning and has maintained visual and radar tracking of it. Based on its flight path and data we can reasonably connect this object to the radar signal picked up over Montana, which flew in proximity to sensitive DOD sites,"" he said. The object was flying at 20,000 feet over Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday. It was ""octagonal"" with strings hanging off and no discernible payload, according to the official and another source briefed on the matter. The path of the object and its altitude raised concerns that it could pose a threat to civilian aircraft, but it did not pose a military threat to anyone on the ground, the official said.Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said Sunday that the operation to down the object over Lake Huron was carried out by pilots from the US Air Force and the National Guard.""Great work by all who carried out this mission both in the air and back at headquarters. We're all interested in exactly what this object was and it's purpose,"" she said in a tweet. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she's been in contact with the federal government after the takedown.""Our national security and safety is always a top priority. I've been in contact with the federal government and our partners who were tracking an object near our airspace. I'm glad to report it has been swiftly, safely, and securely taken down,"" the Democrat tweeted. ""The @MINationalGuard stands ready."" This story has been updated with additional information. "
147,Santos charged in 2017 with theft over bad checks to dog breeders in Pennsylvania Amish country,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/santos-theft-bad-checks-dog-breeders/index.html,"The case was confirmed as ""theft by deception"" by the York County District Attorney's Office, which told CNN it was later dismissed.But it marks the latest disclosure about the embattled New York Republican whose short tenure in Congress has been dominated by questions about his repeated fabrications about his background and resume and inquiries about his campaign finances. Santos is facing multiple investigations, including an FBI probe into allegations that he took off with money raised through his pet charity to provide medical care for the dying dog of a veteran.CNN has reached out to Santos' congressional office and to his personal attorney. Last month, in response to reports about the dying dog, Santos tweeted that his work in ""animal advocacy was the labor of love and hard work"" and called the allegations ""shocking and insane.""The Pennsylvania case, first reported by Politico, centered on a series of nine checks totaling more than $15,000 that went to the dog breeders, according to Tiffany Bogosian, a childhood friend of Santos and personal-injury lawyer who said she assisted Santos in February 2020 after he was served with an extradition warrant. She said she sent an email to a Pennsylvania state trooper, a copy of which she provided to CNN, on Santos' behalf, outlining his contention that one of his four checkbooks had gone missing before the bad checks had been written.""He immediately called his bank upon learning 1/4 check books was missing and all checks were canceled at that time, with a stop pay on all checks,"" Bogosian wrote at the time. She said Santos had been the ""victim of fraud"" as had the people who received the checks. She also attached copies of the checks, several of which said ""puppies"" in the memo field. She said she did not formally serve as Santos' attorney and could not represent him in the Pennsylvania matter, as she is not licensed to practice in the state.In an interview Thursday with CNN, Bogosian said Santos later told her that the charges had been dismissed. Kyle King, a spokesperson for the York County district attorney, told CNN that the case was listed as ""withdrawn or dismissed."" Bogosian, who attended junior high school with Santos, said she no longer believes Santos' account about what transpired with the checks.And in recent weeks, she has emerged as a vocal critic of the congressman. ""I'm going to expose him to the fullest degree as much as I can,"" she said Thursday.Earlier this year, in an interview with The Washington Post, she described an effort by Santos to persuade one of her clients, Christian Lopez, to invest in Harbor City Capital Corp. Santos worked at the firm in 2020 and 2021. Lopez had been awarded $2 million in insurance money after being injured when a drunk driver smashed into his parked car. Lopez told CNN that Santos wouldn't offer details on where the money would be invested, and he declined to invest. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in April 2021 against Harbor City and its founder, Jonathan P. Maroney, alleging the company ran a $17 million ""Ponzi scheme."" Neither Santos nor other employees are named in the SEC complaint. Santos has maintained that he was unaware and not involved in any potential wrongdoing at the company.  On Thursday, Bogosian said she and Lopez were interviewed last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission investigators in relation to Harbor City."

Without enough water, trees are susceptible to bark beetle attacks and disease. Their susceptibility rises when trees are crowded and temperatures are abnormally high,"" the Forest Service said in the release. ""Even with the recent storms from atmospheric rivers, increased tree mortality should be expected in forests until precipitation returns to normal or above normal for a few years.""The dead trees span nearly 2.6 million acres compared to 1.2 million acres in 2021, with the average severity of mortality becoming ""significantly higher."" The highest mortality rates were in the central Sierra Nevada Range and areas farther north, the Forest Service said.""Mortality was particularly severe and widespread in the north interior in several conifer species where drought conditions were most exceptional,"" the report said. The survey's findings come weeks after torrential rain from a series of deadly storms caused extensive flooding, mudslides and landslides -- which killed at least 20 people, turned streets into rivers and destroyed many homes. The back-to-back downpours helped alleviate California's severe drought conditions, but most of the state is still experiencing some level of drought, according to the US Drought Monitor's latest report. That's mainly due to the dire severity of the drought before the storms lashed the state. After more than a century of suppressing fires, the USDA said California's forests are overgrown. And human-induced climate change has been leading to hotter, more intense fires that threaten the increasing number of homes being built in what was wildland. All these factors are behind ""what is now a full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis,"" the Forest Service said.In December, CAL Fire announced it is offering its local partners up to $120 million in grants to improve forest health by reducing fuels, conducting prescribed burns and managing pests. The grant money may also be put toward reforestation, conservation easements and or land purchases."
152,The US says Xi didn't know about the balloon. That raises even more questions,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/china/china-balloon-xi-jinping-unaware-intl-hnk/index.html,"The assessment was communicated to American lawmakers in briefings Thursday, according to CNN reporting -- and if true, could point to what analysts say would be a significant lack of coordination within the Chinese system at a fraught period of China-US relations.The alternative in this scenario -- that Xi was aware that a balloon was being dispatched over the United States ahead of a visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing -- would raise a separate set of concerns about China's decision-making in relation to the US.It could mean that Xi and his top advisers underestimated the potential gravity of the fallout of the mission and the possibility it could imperil Blinken's visit, which would have been the first from the most senior US diplomat since 2018 and had been welcomed by Beijing as a path to easing strained ties. So far, China has offered slim information to fill out its own version of events -- maintaining the balloon was a Chinese civilian research airship blown off course and flatly denying a broader surveillance program.Beijing, in a statement last weekend, appeared to link the device to ""companies,"" rather than the government or military -- though in China the prominence of state-owned enterprises and a robust military-industrial complex blurs the line between the two. However, a senior State Department official said the US believes the balloon was part of a ""PRC fleet of balloons developed to conduct surveillance operations"" and that these activities are ""often undertaken at the direction of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)."" The official added that China has ""overflown these surveillance balloons over more than 40 countries across five continents"" -- without providing more detail.Whether the balloon was civilian or military, its location over the US raises the question of just how closely Xi is aware of potentially sensitive missions being undertaken under his watch within the sprawling, but top-down Chinese system.  If the balloon that traveled over the US is part of what Washington describes as a coordinated and military-affiliated surveillance program, one possibility, according to analysts, is that Xi may have been aware of the program, but not its day-to-day operations.Such a situation, according to Singapore-based analyst Drew Thompson, could have been exacerbated by the level of control wielded by Xi -- who cemented his grip on power last fall as he entered a precedent-breaking third term atop the Communist Party.""The problem with the centralization of power under Xi Jinping is the lack of delegation of authority to lower levels,"" said Thompson, who is a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS).That means that lower-level officials who may have the capacity to more closely monitor such missions may not be empowered to do so, or not be equipped to make political judgments about their impact, he said. Power struggles between lower and higher ranking officials could also complicate communication, he said. ""There is a tension throughout the Chinese system -- it's a feature of Chinese governance, where lower levels fight for their own autonomy, and upper levels fight for greater control,"" he said.Past crises in China have pointed to these tensions, including the outbreaks of both SARS in 2002-2003 and more recently Covid-19, where reporting delays were widely seen as having slowed the response and compounded the problem. Some blamed local officials who feared repercussions, or were accustomed to a system where information flows from the top down, not the bottom up.Balloon launches could also fall into a gap in which operations were not managed or overseen in the same way as space or other aircraft missions, according to Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago.In this case, entities launching balloons may have received ""little or no push back from other countries, including the United States"" and ""increasingly seen such launches as routine based on weather conditions and at modest costs,"" Yang said.""As a result, while the leaders of these programs have also become emboldened over time to test new routes, it was likely that they didn't get top priority attention from the perspective of political risk,"" he said.Biden officials expressed the belief that both the senior leadership of the People's Liberation Army and Chinese Communist Party, including Xi, were also unaware of the balloon mission over the US, and that China is still trying to figure out how this happened, a source familiar with the Thursday briefing to Congress told CNN.China's Foreign Ministry appeared caught off-guard by the situation as it publicly unfolded over the past week -- releasing its first explanation of the incident more than 12 hours after the Pentagon announced it was tracking a suspected surveillance balloon.But some observers of elite Chinese politics remain skeptical that Xi would have been unaware of a balloon dispatched to US airspace or that lower-level officials would conduct such a mission that could impact US-China relations without his knowledge.""Because of his personality, he wants 100% (control),"" said Alfred Wu, an associate professor, also at the NUS Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. ""I don't think Xi Jinping allows for that kind of autonomy."" Instead, Xi may have been comfortable with an incident that diverted the attention of a public frustrated amid a faltering economy after years under the recently dismantled zero-Covid policy -- but underestimated the US domestic response that resulted in the postponed talks, Wu said. Beijing, for its part, has accused the US of ""overreacting"" in its decision to shoot down the balloon on Saturday.Meanwhile, Washington may be offering its message that Xi wasn't aware of the situation as it seeks to ""continue the dialogue"" started during a meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden at the G20 summit in Bali, according to Wu.""They may want to offer (China) some face,"" he said."

154,From viral powerlifting sensation to Super Bowl quarterback: the rise of Jalen Hurts,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/sport/jalen-hurts-profile-philadelphia-eagles-spt-intl/index.html,"That has become the rallying cry of the Philadelphia Eagles. The catchphrase which sums up the city's attitude towards adversity is emblazoned on sweatshirts, billboards and even Lincoln Financial Field as the team prepares for Sunday's Super Bowl. Pressure in Philadelphia is unlike anywhere else. The baying crowd, the intense media and fans unafraid of expressing their unfiltered feelings -- the booing and throwing of snowballs at Santa Claus in 1968 has gone down in notorious sport history.The atmosphere has proven too much for many sporting stars. Sometimes, the city of brotherly love isn't so friendly. But for Jalen Hurts, the pressure that comes with being the starting quarterback for the city's NFL team has been like water off a duck's back. Decked out in the green of the Eagles, the 24-year-old has oozed calm and composure as he's ascended to the top of his field in just his second full season as a starter, becoming the driving force behind the team's run to the Super Bowl. But, from his all-women support team to his love of singer Anita Baker and the viral videos of his powerlifting achievements, Hurts is more than just an NFL quarterback. SurroundingsWhatever he's turned his hand to, he's succeeded at. Whether it be football, lifting weights or athletics, Hurts achieves the goals he sets for himself. However, that can't be said for his rendition of the Eagles' fight song ""Fly, Eagles Fly"" -- his singing on the riser after winning the NFC Championship indicated he needs to spend more time with a singing instructor than in the gym. Singing aside, Hurts' achievements are a tribute to not only his talents but also to the support team he has assembled. His father, Averion, was the head coach at Channelview High School during Hurts' time there and helped develop his son's game as he took his formative steps.Averion told ESPN that having worked with his son and seen how he's handled pressure in the biggest moments of his career, he believed his biggest attribute wasn't his running ability or his big arm, but his ""mental capacity.""The quarterback has constructed an all-women support network around him, spearheaded by Hurts' agent, Nicole Lynn of Klutch Sports Group. Hurts is a keen advocate for empowering the women around him, something he says goes back to seeing his mother, Pamela, raise a family while studying for a master's degree. ""I admire anyone who puts their head down and works for what they want. And I know women who do that daily, but they don't get the same praise as men -- they don't get the praise that they deserve,"" Hurts told Sports Illustrated. ""I've seen that now with tons of different women in my life that are hustlers. Athletes, coaches, women in the business world of sports. I see it all the time. And they deserve their flowers too. So if me saying something about it brings more attention to it, then I'm all for that.""As part of the NFL's ""My Cause, My Cleats"" initiative earlier this season, Hurts had the motto ""Women Empowerment"" emblazoned on his shoes.Lynn told Sports Illustrated last year that she first got in contact with Hurts via a direct message on Instagram after his final college game, in what she describes as a ""total Hail Mary.""She will become the first Black woman agent to represent an NFL quarterback in the Super Bowl and Hurts says he was drawn to working with Lynn because of her determination. ""I know the agent world in the NFL, and all sports, is very male-dominated,"" he told Sports Illustrated. ""But Nicole was really on top of her stuff. She was prepared. She knew what she was talking about. She was hungry. And she was determined. ""And I feel that determination like that never rests. Once you come across such a determined individual, that just hits me a little different.""Hurts added: ""I've put a lot of trust and faith in a female-driven team. I have a team of straight hustlers ... They get things done. And that's how I am on the field and off the field. We're all trying to accomplish something.""UpwardsFootball might not have been many people's first exposure to Hurts. Many people might have first heard of him from his powerlifting exploits. Having initially began lifting when he was a teenager, Hurts attended powerlifting meets during his high school days.Videos of Hurts squatting over 500 pounds circulated on social media, but he really became an internet sensation when he lifted 600 pounds during his time at the University of Oklahoma. Steadily though, his on-field performances at college began to earn him wider recognition, especially when he started for the Alabama Crimson Tide as a true freshman, the first to do so for 32 years. Despite the season ending in heartbreak when Alabama lost in the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship against the Clemson Tigers, Hurts had established himself as a star, dual-threat quarterback in the making. But just when everything seemed to be falling into place, Hurts faced adversity. Having led Alabama once again to the National Championship game a year later, Alabama fell behind 13-0 at halftime to Georgia. Needing a spark, Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban benched Hurts in favor of true freshman Tua Tagovailoa -- Tagovailoa led a dramatic comeback which resulted in a 26-23 overtime victory. The Houston native was forced to play second fiddle behind Tagovailoa in his junior season, coming in for the future Miami Dolphins quarterback on select plays due to his running ability and later in the season when Tagovailoa suffered an injury.In his final year of college eligibility, Hurts transferred to Oklahoma where he reinstated himself as an option for NFL teams in the upcoming draft after a successful season. Hurts finished second in Heisman Trophy voting, behind Joe Burrow, after posting 3,851 passing yards, 32 passing touchdowns, and just eight interceptions, as well as 1,298 rushing yards and 20 rushing touchdowns.Despite all the good performances he'd put on tape, there were doubts about his overall potential heading into the NFL. According to the official NFL draft profile on Hurts, he would ""struggle to beat NFL defenses from the pocket"" and his future in the league would be a ""solid backup with upward mobility.""Having declared for the draft, Hurts saw his name slip down the draftboard before eventually being picked by the Eagles with the 53rd overall pick in the second round. The pick was a surprise to many, with starter Carson Wentz just two years removed from an MVP-level season. After leading the Eagles to this year's Super Bowl, Hurts remembers dealing with some of the backlash he received for being drafted to Philadelphia. ""My first year here [people] probably didn't even want [me drafted] here. It was probably one of those things. But it always handles itself,"" he told ESPN following the 31-7 win over the 49ers in the NFC Championship game. ""It was a big surprise to many. My favorite [Bible] verse, I went through a lot of stuff in college and it kind of stuck with me, John 13:7: 'You may not know now but later you'll understand.' Hopefully, people understand.""Although he began the 2020 season as the third-choice quarterback, he eventually earned himself the backup job behind Wentz, featuring in games in specific moments where his dynamic running ability tended to be utilized. By December, Hurts had been named the starter over Wentz in a struggling Eagles team with a soon-to-be-fired head coach. With Nick Sirianni instilled as the head coach and Wentz traded away, the starting job was Hurts come 2021. And despite some bumps in the road, he and the rest of the offense showed glimpses of a bright future ahead, finishing with a 9-8 record and one of the most threatening running offenses in the league. While there were hints last year, not even the most hopeful of Philadelphia fans could have predicted the leap Hurts has made this year. In the 15 games that he started in the regular season, the Eagles finished 14-1, with Hurts setting career highs in passing years, passing touchdowns, completion percentage, quarterback rating and rushing touchdowns. The improvement he's shown with his throwing ability, paired with his running ability, has made the Eagles offense unstoppable, something they displayed emphatically in their victory over the 49ers in the NFC Championship. HistoryIn making the Super Bowl, Hurts will face the Kansas City Chiefs and their star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes. The match-up is particularly significant as it will be the first Super Bowl in which a Black quarterback will start for both teams. Hurts is just the eighth Black quarterback to start in the Super Bowl and Philadelphia's second Black quarterback to start in a Super Bowl, joining Donovan McNabb who started Super Bowl XXXIX. Should the Eagles win at State Farm Stadium, Hurts will become the fourth Black quarterback to win an NFL championship after Doug Williams with the then-Washington Redskins in 1988, Russell Wilson with the Seattle Seahawks in 2014 and Mahomes in 2020.""The first time for two [Black quarterbacks] to go head-to-head, that's uplifting the next generation of quarterbacks,"" Hurts said when asked about the significance of the moment.""That four-year-old, five-year-old kid back in Houston, back in Philly, back in Texas, Louisiana, wherever across the world, it shows that regardless of what someone may say or have an opinion about you, you can do it.""I value the platform I have, I'm sure like Pat does, as well. We just want to inspire the next people.""Individually, Hurts has been recognized for his stellar season, being named as one of the five finalists for the NFL's most prestigious individual accolade, the Most Valuable Player award.Hurts has found it difficult to put into words the road he's been on. ""I don't really know how to feel, to be honest. You work really hard to put yourself in this position and I'm forever grateful,"" he said. ""Only God knows the things that each individual on this team has been able to overcome for us to come together as a team and do something special as a group. That's what means the most. I always want to go out there and give my best regardless of what's going on because I don't want to let down the guy next to me. That makes us all go harder.""I know I've been through a lot personally, but I don't want to steer away from the direction of how good this team has been at playing together, being together and challenging one another. ""When we experience some painful times and some tough times, we always found a way to overcome. You want to be going into a situation like this, and we have a chance to go out there and win it all, so we want to prepare to go do that.""With one game to go between him and history, Hurts said his Eagles team hasn't just come to make up the numbers. ""I didn't put in all that work for no reason,"" he said. ""I put all this work in, we put all this work in, to have opportunities like this. It'll be a fun one.""We just want to go out there and do what we've done this whole entire time, to try and play clean football and play together. We've come here to finish the job.""A remarkable rise for a second-round draft pick who was doubted even at the beginning of this season. Handling pressure isn't for everybody, but, come rain or shine, as Hurts says: ""It's a Philly thing."""
155,Here's what happened to the federal debt under past presidents -- and why it's hard to assign blame,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/us-federal-debt-past-presidents/index.html,"But both parties have played a role in adding to the debt, and it's difficult to cast blame fairly.While presidents sign bills into law, it's Congress -- which may or may not be controlled by the president's party -- that passes spending legislation and tax reforms. Plus, the president and Congress do not have full control over the economy, which can sometimes have a bigger impact on the debt than laws. Further still, decisions made by past presidents and lawmakers continue to have an impact on the amount of debt acquired today. ""Most of the problem has not been created by any recent officeholder,"" said Charles Blahous, senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and author of the paper, ""Why We Have Federal Deficits."" The 2021 report attempts three different ways to assign blame for the federal government's long-term debt problem. More recent legislation, like pandemic-related spending and expanding access to affordable health care, has added to the debt. But the impact of those laws on the long-term structural fiscal imbalance are dwarfed by the creation of Medicare and Medicaid and increases to Social Security made between 1965 and 1972.""Despite all the political rhetoric expended today to cast blame for skyrocketing federal deficits ... the largest drivers of the structural federal fiscal imbalance were enacted roughly a half-century ago,"" Blahous wrote in his report. How big is the US debt?To put the size of the federal debt in some context, it's currently at about the same size as 97% of the country's gross domestic product, or GDP, according to data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. That's a bigger share than at any other time since 1946, except for fiscal year 2020 when unprecedented borrowing occurred to fight Covid-19.The federal debt as a share of GDP has more than doubled over the past two decades. It was less than 35% in 2003. ""I think the biggest issue is that we have growing polarization and pandering. Both sides have just said, 'You know what, I'm just going to give voters what they want.' And what they want are tax cuts and big new spending,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent nonprofit. In the late 1990s, the federal debt share of GDP actually fell when a strong economy and less defense spending helped lead to a balanced budget under President Bill Clinton and a Republican-controlled Congress -- the most recent time the US has seen a budget surplus rather than deficit. But since then, the nation has seen three recessions that weakened the economy, and the baby boomer generation is now leaving the workforce in droves, straining Social Security and Medicare. More recently, under both President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, there has been trillions of dollars of spending to help the economy rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic. Many economists, though, would argue that much of that spending was beneficial and that more spending is a good thing when the economy is in trouble.It's worth noting that the figures used in the graph above measure debt held by the public, which experts at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argue is more economically meaningful than gross debt. The former measures the government's borrowing from the private sector and foreign governments, excluding debt it owes itself. Debt held by the public is currently about $24 trillion, and gross debt, which is subject to the congressional limit, is about $31 trillion.LBJ and Nixon: Medicare, Medicaid and Social SecuritySome of the government programs contributing most to the long-term federal fiscal imbalance continue to be Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid -- health care programs for the elderly and the poor, respectively -- were created under President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, in 1965. They were subsequently expanded under President Richard Nixon, a Republican, who also approved an increase to Social Security in 1972. Some experts disagree about Social Security's impact on federal deficits. But Blahous specifically looks at its impact on the long-term fiscal imbalance.Blahous found that all subsequent legislation combined, from 1973 to late 2021, has done less to exacerbate the long-term budget situation than the laws passed during those eight years under Johnson and Nixon.Still, Blahous notes, more recent presidents and lawmakers have failed to fix the problem by amending these politically popular programs. In fact, one of the most tense moments during Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday was when he accused some Republicans of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare. How more recent legislation contributes to the long-term problemLegislation from recent decades has certainly added further to the long-term fiscal problem, but to a smaller extent than the Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security laws passed under Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon before 1973, according to Blahous. The creation of new health marketplace subsidies and expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, is a big driver of the long-term budget imbalance, as well as the subsequent repeal of some of the Affordable Care Act taxes in 2019 under Trump.Blahous also points to the expansions to Medicaid under presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, as well as the creation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit in 2003 under President George W. Bush as drivers of the long-term problem. Another significant contributor to the fiscal imbalance is the American Taxpayer Relief Act, signed by Obama in early 2013, which made some Bush-era tax cuts permanent. One-time spending plans, like funding for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq or the pandemic-related aid packages, have less of an impact on the long-term problem even if they do add to the annual deficit at the time. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 -- passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by Trump -- added to the deficits in the short term. But many of the tax cuts are scheduled to expire in 2025 and therefore have a smaller impact on the federal debt over the long run, according to Blahous' analysis. Still, all these measures in combination worsened the fiscal outlook, as of late 2021, by little more than two-thirds as much as the major legislation of 1965-1972, Blahous wrote."

158,Is your school equipped to save a life? Here's how you'll know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/health/school-sports-safety-gupta-wellness/index.html,"As a trauma neurosurgeon myself, I was in awe of the dozens of medical professionals -- athletic trainers, doctors and EMTs  -- who put their years of training into action within seconds. The immediate recognition that this wasn't a routine injury and the speedy administration of CPR and defibrillation saved his heart, his brain and his life. Six weeks later, we now hear Dr. Thomas Mayer, the medical director of the NFL Players Association, say ""I guarantee you that Damar Hamlin will play professional football again."" The rescue response was awesome to watch and reflected the remarkable resources and planning that go into every game played in the NFL. As a parent, though, I couldn't help but wonder what would've happened if Hamlin faced this when he was still in high school. What if it would've happened to any of my three teenage kids at their school? Would they have been saved as well? Sudden cardiac deaths are rare in young people, but you may be surprised to know that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 2,000 such deaths in people under the age of 25 every year.While the overall number of cardiac arrests has stayed largely consistent, there is no question that school safety efforts -- and cardiac arrest survival rates -- have improved over the years. Florida was the first state to enact laws requiring automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, in schools in 1999, and there are now 20 states, along with the District of Columbia, with similar mandates, according to  the American College of Cardiology. Even in most of the states with no requirement on the books, AEDs are available in the majority of schools. Most venues with more than 200 people -- large businesses, stadiums, casinos and concert halls -- are required to have AEDs as well, but there has been a major focus on schools in recent decades, considering that about 20% of the US population is on school grounds at any one time. In the past quarter-century, we went from hardly any AEDs being present in schools to a remarkable awareness of the lifesaving potential they hold. That increased awareness and attention to defibrillators and CPR has directly resulted in more athletes surviving, says Dr. Jonathan Drezner, director of the University of Washington Medicine Center for Sports Cardiology and team physician for the Seattle Seahawks.He points out that when he began investigating sudden cardiac arrest in young athletes in the early 2000s, survival rates hovered around 11%. A more recent study of young athletes from 2014 to 2018 found that survival rates have climbed to an average of 68%. That's an improvement of more than 500% in less than two decades. Still, we can and must do better, especially at the high school level. While there is increased awareness and availability of AEDs, none of that matters if the lifesaving device can't be accessed within two to three minutes. AEDs and accessibilityAs part of a CNN investigation, we wanted a detailed understanding not just of AED availability in schools but of real-life accessibility. Speed matters when someone has suddenly dropped due to cardiac arrest. The best estimates are that every minute without defibrillation reduces survival by up to 10%.  That's why Dr. Victoria Vetter, a cardiologist with the Cardiac Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told us that ""just having an AED is not sufficient."" ""You need to make sure that there is an accessible AED that is not locked in the nurse's office or in some back office,"" Vetter said.The American Heart Association recommends that defibrillators be placed within a two- to three-minute walk. Unfortunately, even in schools that have diligently purchased devices -- typically at a cost of $1,000 to $2,000 -- too many of them are not readily accessible. One small study of secondary public schools in Ohio and southeast Michigan found that in more than 70% of the 24 public schools surveyed, the devices simply couldn't be reached in time. Another study of schools in Oregon found that people in just half of the schools surveyed could access the devices within four minutes of a field or arena. In Vermont, 81% of the state's 74 schools had defibrillators near athletic fields or arenas; half of the time, the AEDs were kept in the main office, with the nurse or in the lobby. As part of our investigation, we defined AED access as knowing where the AEDs are in case of emergency. But it is essential to make sure they are always fully charged and that drills are regularly run to ensure people know how to use them.""We have fire drills in schools generally, every month. We have active shooter drills. But we do not in most schools have sudden cardiac arrest drills,"" Vetter said. Nationally, she said, just a handful of states require schools to practice cardiac emergency plans. Role of athletic trainers Many people have held up the NFL's cardiac response as the gold standard: quick action and accessibility. Watching the remarkable 30-person team of professionals who saved Hamlin, many would argue that most high schools don't have the resources to employ dozens of medical professionals. But it doesn't take an army to save a life. ""A single person can save a young athlete's life if they promptly recognize cardiac arrest, call for help, start CPR and someone gets the AED,"" said the Seahawks' Drezner. ""The treatment algorithm really is that simple."" For many schools, that person would be an athletic trainer, the medical professional on the field. And yet, in about a third of the nation's high schools, there is no access to athletic trainers at all. ""You have to ask yourself:  When those athletes get injured, who's addressing those injuries? Who's there to provide the emergency action plan in case something like this happens?"" asked Kathy Dieringer, president of the National Athletic Trainers' Association. Drezner's work has found that the survival rate from cardiac arrest for young athletes nearly doubled to over 80% when an athletic trainer was present or an AED was used. Part of the reason is that schools with athletic trainers were also the ones most likely to have emergency plans and AEDs. As things stand now, schools least likely to have athletic trainers are in urban or rural areas, and the schools most likely to have them are in the suburbs, areas that tend to have higher incomes. ""If I were a parent, I would ask those questions,"" Dieringer said. ""Where are the AEDs in my school? Are they accessible, and does someone know how to use them if they're needed?""One death every three daysSudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in young competitive athletes, with one study finding as many as one death every three days in youth sports.One of those deaths was 16-year-old Matthew Mangine Jr., a soccer player at St. Henry District High School in Erlanger, Kentucky. In 2020, Matthew collapsed on the soccer field. ""There were five AEDs at the school that night, and one wasn't brought to him,"" his father, Matthew Mangine Sr., told the local news. ""That night, his initial shock came from EMS. They arrived roughly 12 minutes after he was down."" Matthew died an hour later at the hospital. John and Luann Ellsessar also know that pain well. They lost their 16-year-old son, Michael, on the football field when he went into cardiac arrest during a game in 2010. ""There was no ambulance or AED on the field, and it took 15 minutes for the squad to arrive,"" John told CNN. ""If that ambulance is arriving 15 minutes later, he's already 150% gone."" John recalls that the doctors at the hospital worked on Michael for 45 minutes before pronouncing him dead. Fortunately, this wasn't the story for Peter Laake. In 2021, the star lacrosse player was already on the varsity team as a freshman at Loyola Blakefield in Towson, Maryland. Peter was hit on the left side in what was apparently a normal play, but what followed wasn't normal at all. Peter told me he blacked out and collapsed on the field. Jeremy Parr, the school's athletic trainer, said he immediately went to Peter's side and checked for a pulse. ""With no pulse, no breathing, we needed to get the AED and EMS activated as soon as possible,"" Parr told me when I spoke with him recently. CPR was started, and in Peter's case, the AED data showed that his heart was beating again within two to three minutes. Within three weeks, Peter was back on the field. It's an example of how things should work and could work in all schools. Training in CPR for all staff, athletic and educational. Availability and accessibility of AEDs with regular drills to make sure execution is flawless. An emergency action plan that is posted and reviewed. As a parent, you can and should ask about all of this yourself. After witnessing what happened to Hamlin, I did just that with the athletic department at my own children's school. In a world where we have many complicated problems, saving someone's life is possible with the knowledge and resources we have right now. With a plan, it is easy. We often prioritize buses, fields and athletic equipment, but cardiac safety must also be at the top of the list. As Parr told me, when the unthinkable happens, ""every athlete deserves the chance to survive."""
159,Super Bowl ticket prices are declining. They'll still cost thousands of dollars,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/super-bowl-lvii-ticket-prices/index.html,"StubHub said that the average price customers are paying for a ticket Thursday was $6,800. The cheapest seats to Sunday's match up between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs are selling at about $3,200 apiece. Overall prices for the big game in Glendale, Arizona are trending down with prices dropping each day. In fact, StubHub said that ticket prices have dropped more than 10% since the teams were decided on February 12. Attending this year's game is costing fans substantially less than last year's match up between the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams at LA's SoFi Stadium. That's to be expected, since the home team was playing in their own city and the country's second-largest metropolitan area. Tickets were averaging nearly $10,000 each, according to StubHub. SeatGeek, another ticket selling website, shows ticket prices for Sunday's game slowly declining and were averaging about $6,500 on Thursday. The most expensive ticket on its website costs $30,000 and is located near the field; the cheapest is $4,200.At an average of $445 per night, however, hotel prices in the Phoenix area will be relatively expensive, making it the second-highest level for a Super Bowl week, according to STR, a hospitality analytics firm that tracks prices. The most expensive Super Bowl was in 2016 in San Francisco when rooms averaged $451 per night.In addition to the Super Bowl, the city is also hosting a PGA event that features golf's biggest players, including Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth. Those two events on the same weekend puts the local hotel occupancy rate to 94%, the firm said. The normal rate for a hotel room is around $160 per night, STR said.  "
160,Lula says Brazil is no more divided than the US as he meets Biden,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/americas/brazil-president-lula-interview-intl-latam/index.html,"""Here there's also a split, much more, or as serious as Brazil -- Democrats and Republicans are very split up. Love it or leave it, that's more or less what's going on,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in Washington, adding that Brazil does not have ""a hatred culture.""Both Lula and Biden saw government buildings sacked in the aftermath of their presidential elections by far-right elements that have posed huge tests for their respective democracies.""Never could we imagine that in a country that was the symbol of democracy in the world -- someone could try to invade the Capitol,"" he said about the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot in the US. The similarities between the January 8 attack on Brasilia and the US insurrection include former President Jair Bolsonaro's close alignment with former US President Donald Trump. Lula calls Bolsonaro a ""faithful copycat of Trump,"" saying both men ""don't enjoy trade unions... They don't like workers, don't like women. They don't like Black people.""Both ex-leaders were repeatedly criticized during their terms for using racist and misogynistic language.Even so, Lula is not convinced all Bolsonaro supporters are adherents to his views. ""I am convinced that not everybody that voted for Bolsonaro follows Bolsonarism,"" he said.  After his election loss, Bolsonaro decamped for the United States. He has been living near Orlando, Florida, for more than a month, prompting some Democratic Party lawmakers to call for him to leave the country. Will Lula ask Biden to help extradite Bolsonaro back to Brazil? ""I don't know, I'm not going to talk about President Biden about that, this will depend on courts,"" he replied. ""One day he has to come back to Brazil and face all the lawsuits against him.""Bolsonaro faces ""almost 12 lawsuits against him in Brazil, more cases will come in,"" Lula said, adding that he believes his former rival will ""be convicted in some international court because of the genocide with Covid (outbreak) because half of the people that died in Brazil during Covid was the responsibility of the federal government."" He also alleged that Bolsonaro could be ""punished"" by courts for ""the genocide against the Yanomami indigenous people"" after illegal mining in their protected territory soared during his term. Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered an investigation to determine whether the actions of the Bolsonaro government amounted to ""genocide"" of the Yanomami -- who have seen disease and malnutrition tear through their community in the last four years. Bolsonaro has previously called such accusation a ""left-wing farce"" on his official Telegram channel. Biden talksLula's talks with Biden on Friday are expected to center around combating climate change and tackling anti-democratic extremism.While Lula believes ""democracy will prevail"" in Brazil, he worries about about the rise of extreme right groups around the world.""It's in Brazil, it's in Spain, it's in France, and they are in Hungary, in Germany. We have an organized extreme right in the world and if we're not careful, this will be a Nazi attitude from there. This is a denial attitude we haven't seen before,"" he said.He agrees there is much to be done in Brazil about the climate, saying the country's commitment to ""reduce greenhouse emissions"" by 39% would have to include rewarding local ""mayors and governors, who guarantee no more burning of the forests.""By extending an early invitation to Lula to visit the White House, Biden hopes to cultivate closer ties and demonstrate his support for one of the Western Hemisphere's key players.Biden quickly called Lula following his victory late last year, hoping to demonstrate support after Bolsonaro had laid the groundwork to question the election results. The move was received well among Lula's officials, who saw it as a sign Biden was looking to restore US-Brazil ties.They have met previously -- when Biden was vice president, he met Lula on the sidelines of a gathering in Chile. But as counterparts, they will look to deepen what has traditionally been a key bilateral relationship in the Western Hemisphere, strained in recent years by the diametrically opposed Biden and Bolsonaro.While they have much in common, Lula -- like many leaders in middle income and developing countries -- has adopted a policy of non-intervention over the war in Ukraine.He has rebuffed efforts led by Biden to unite the global community in opposition to Russia's invasion. Speaking to CNN, Lula said that Ukraine had the right to defend itself ""because the invasion was a mistake on the part of Russia."" He explained he refused to provide ammunition to Ukraine because, ""I don't want to go join the war. I want to end the war."" Lula has sought be a global statesman who could broker a truce between Russia and Ukraine, telling CNN that he has begun this ""work"" by speaking to the German Chancellor, who visited Brazil in January. ""I want to talk about peace with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. I want to talk about peace with President Biden, I want to talk about peace with (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping. I want to talk about peace with India, with Indonesia... because for me the world will only develop itself if we have peace,"" he said. Another thing Lula shares with Biden is age. They are both elderly presidents: Biden is 80 years old, while Lula is 77. When asked about it, Lula said aging only exists for those who don't have a cause to fight for. ""I am 77 years of age, and ... I have the energy and power of someone who is 30 years old,"" he said. ""I don't sleep because my home is the Brazilian people -- I have to improve the lives of my people."" "

""As a result of the flight crew's repeated unwillingness to proceed with a recorded interview, subpoenas for their testimony have been issued.""The NTSB report says the American Airlines 777 crossed an active runway without clearance from air traffic control, causing a Delta 737 to abort its takeoff.The report says the two aircraft came within 1,400 feet of each other.Following the report, the NTSB issued a statement saying investigators ""frequently use recording devices in interviews, particularly with those who had roles in operating the equipment involved in the accident or incident.""The agency says it attempted to interview the American crew on three separate occasions and issued a subpoena Friday to the three crew members involved in the incident. They have seven days to respond, the NTSB says.The statement notes that the airline itself has cooperated with the investigation.Investigators have accepted written statements from the Delta crew and determined that they contain ""sufficient information.""  As CNN has previously reported, the American Airlines flight continued on to London's Heathrow airport. The flight voice recorders on both aircraft were overwritten, meaning investigators can't hear what was said in the cockpit at the time of the incident.The NTSB says the American crew, through their union, the Allied Pilots Association, would not consent to the interview.""NTSB has determined that this investigation requires that the flight crew interviews be audio recorded and transcribed by a court reporter to ensure the highest degree of accuracy, completeness, and efficiency,"" the report says.The APA said in a statement that historically these interviews have not been recorded.""We join in the goal of creating an accurate record of all interviews conducted in the course of an investigation,"" the statement said. ""However, we firmly believe the introduction of electronic recording devices into witness interviews is more likely to hinder the investigation process than it is to improve it. Not only may the recording of interviews lead to less candid responses from those witnesses who may choose to proceed under such requirements, but the existence and potential availability of interview recordings upon conclusion of an investigation will tend to lead many otherwise willing crew members to elect not to participate in interviews at all. Either outcome would not serve to advance the goal of conducting effective investigations in order to promote aviation safety.""The union says the interviews should be ""fact-finding"" and not adversarial.""We are confident that an acceptable solution to this issue exists that would satisfy the needs and concerns of all parties involved in these investigatory interviews,"" the union wrote.

162,Opinion: Former Manhattan prosecutor has given Trump a gift,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/opinions/bragg-pomerantz-fight-trump-gift-rodgers/index.html,"In February 2021, Mark Pomerantz, a very experienced former federal prosecutor, joined former Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office and led the criminal investigations into former President Donald Trump's financial dealings. Before Vance retired at the end of 2021, the Manhattan DA's office indicted two Trump Organization companies, along with its Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. In December 2022, a jury found Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. guilty on all counts. Weisselberg, who struck a plea deal with the prosecutors, was sentenced in January to five months in jail.By 2022, Pomerantz thought his team had sufficient evidence to file felony charges against Trump in a separate case. But Bragg, the new DA who succeeded Vance, was concerned there wasn't enough evidence to make the case that Trump intended to break the law.  Pomerantz ended up resigning in a public, noisy fashion, writing, ""I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now, and on the existing record, is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest."" And now, Pomerantz has written a book about the case. The gist of Pomerantz's claim is that he had assembled a strong criminal case against Trump, but Bragg lacked enthusiasm, and possibly the courage, to bring it. Bragg, for his part, has said that the case was not ready in early 2022 but that the investigation is still ongoing.The Manhattan DA's office recently impaneled a grand jury and began presenting evidence about Trump's alleged role in a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. (Trump has denied the affair with Daniels, and any wrongdoing.) Bragg's office also alleges that Pomerantz's public disclosure of investigative details and inner deliberations of the office violate Pomerantz's confidentiality obligations and may harm the case. A lot of ink has been spilled about the Bragg/Pomerantz affair. I won't rehash all the details here, although I will note that the more that comes out, the more it looks like Bragg has the better of the arguments about the readiness of Pomerantz's case and the strength of his legal theories. The truth is that so many things about charging Trump would be unprecedented and therefore subject to legal uncertainty; under these circumstances, making sure the evidence is strong and the legal theory is solid before proceeding with charges is eminently reasonable. In any case, Pomerantz has done something worse than being overly aggressive in pushing for charges in internal meetings. Because, putting aside rank corruption or extreme incompetence — which absolutely no one alleges here — a prosecutor should never, ever, disclose anything about a pending investigation that could jeopardize that investigation. Pomerantz's actions have led to the disclosure of significant information about the DA's investigation, the evidence it gathered, the charges under consideration, the legal theories that some prosecutors favored, and the sometimes contradictory views of all of those things among different lawyers within the office. Pomerantz has also criticized the office's lawyers and questioned their legal abilities. Legal experts have opined that Pomerantz's statements about the investigation may have violated his duty of confidentiality, his obligations under the legal ethics code and potentially even the criminal grand jury secrecy rules. (Pomerantz said in a statement, ""I am confident that all of my actions with respect to the Trump investigation, including the writing of my forthcoming book, are consistent with my legal and ethical obligations."")But equally bad, in my view, is that Pomerantz has given Trump a gift. To be clear, even without Pomerantz's revelations, a Trump defense would be sure to include claims of selective and vindictive prosecution — it has become a standard response from Trump to play the victim. And Trump, if charged, will undoubtedly attack the legal theory put forward by prosecutors, particularly any novel applications of New York law. But now those claims will carry more weight due to the revelations of former prosecution team member Pomerantz and what we know about the infighting among the prosecutors themselves.The irony is that the thing that Pomerantz claimed he wanted most in his resignation letter was for Trump to be held accountable. And yet the end result of this campaign of Pomerantz's may be to make it less, not more, likely that accountability in the form of a conviction of Trump ever comes to pass. For any true prosecutor, that's a terrible thing. "

166,The Super Bowl: America's great unifier,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/sport/super-bowl-americas-great-unifier-spt-intl/index.html,"The Super Bowl and the NFL in general seem to bring together Americans in a way few other things can. In an era of streaming and cable television, most programs capture only a small portion of America's over 330 million-person population. Last year, the highest non-football program was the State of the Union, which under 40 million Americans watched -- the viewership this year was even lower.When it came to the highest-rated non-sports show on one network, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade on NBC took the prize; a mere 22 million Americans tuned into that. The Super Bowl, meanwhile, was watched by nearly 100 million people on NBC last year. When you combine streaming and Spanish language broadcast, viewership topped 110 million. Last year was no anomaly either: the Super Bowl has crossed the 100 million viewership threshold over 10 times. The only non-Super Bowl show ever to hit those numbers was the series finale of M*A*S*H, which aired 40 years ago. No other non-Super Bowl show has ever come close to that, and I'm not sure it ever will. The way the Super Bowl is able to unite Americans is a few fold. Part of it has to do with the popularity of football in America (more on that in a second), but there's a lot more to it. The Super Bowl is a bunch of shows wrapped into one. It's the only spectacle I know of where people watch just for the commercials. SSRS polling shows that 24% of people who watch the Super Bowl say their favorite thing about the game is the commercials. No wonder that the price of a 30-second ad is going to cost advertisers about $7 million this year. The Super Bowl is also a much-raved about music show at halftime. Big stars have been performing at the Super Bowl for over 30 years now. This year, it is Rihanna -- who has sold hundreds of millions of records and won nine Grammys -- making her live-music return. Over 10% of people who watch the big game say the halftime show is their favorite thing. But I'd argue that the ability for the Super Bowl and the NFL to be so popular ultimately comes down to the fact that it bridges the partisan divide in our country. We can see this well in Google searches. For most topics, there is some sort of correlation between how states voted in the last presidential election and how many people in a given state are searching for said topic. There is a very strong correlation, for example, between searches for the Academy Awards and vote patterns in the 2020 presidential election with states Biden won far more likely to have interest in the Oscars. The Oscars, not surprisingly, have seen their ratings fall from nearly 60 million in the late 1990s to less than 20 million today. The Super Bowl has maintained its high ratings in part because there is basically no correlation between past voting patterns and interest in the Super Bowl according to Google searches. This shouldn't be surprising given what I had previously found. Blue states and red states have never seen a big divide in terms of how they search for the NFL overall. The NFL is unique in this regard, as most major sports show some geographic correlation with past election results. And we're not just seeing the lack of a red and blue divide on Google. We see it in the polling as well. A Washington Post poll taken in 2022 found that 67% of Americans were fans of football. No other sport tested topped 50%. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 66% were fans. For Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 70% were fans. It was the only sport where more than 50% of both Democrats and Republicans were fans of the sport. There hasn't been a lot of recent polling that meets CNN's standards for publication on Super Bowl fandom specifically, but the polling we do have suggests that the adulation Americans have for football specifically carries over to the big game.A Monmouth University poll from 2019 found that there was just a four-point difference between the percentage of Democrats and Republicans who were going to watch the Super Bowl. About the only thing that does divide Americans when it comes to the Super Bowl is ""Who do I root for?"" On that issue, I say follow your heart. I'm hoping for a nice, clean game."
167,Jake Tapper: I wouldn't change being a Philly fan for anything,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/sport/philadelphia-eagles-jake-tapper-spt-intl/index.html,"Yes, I'm a long-suffering Philly sports fan, though truth be told we haven't been suffering all that much recently. My fandom (phan-dom?) first peaked in the early 1980s with the Phillies win in 1980 when I was 11, Eagles NFC Championship (then Super Bowl loss to the Raiders...) in 1981 and Sixers championship in 1983. The devotion my friends and I had to these teams at the time seemed sweet and innocent.And then because of how apps made it easier to follow sports in the last five or so years, I have been brought back to that mindset: boyish, childlike, my happiness rising or falling depending upon a team's performance beyond any rational thought. Right in time for these teams to achieve a convergence of excellence.If you're not from Philly, maybe you don't care. Maybe, you don't like us and find it all off-putting. As Eagles center Jason Kelce put it in 2018 after our glorious Super Bowl victory against the villainous Tom Brady-led Patriots, ""No one likes us. We don't care.""That's because historically for so many of us one thing has united all those franchises: pain. I know that if I bothered to follow the MLS, I'm sure I could induce even more of it by supporting the Philadelphia Union. There's just something about Philadelphia that makes our teams frustratingly, maddeningly prone to delivering disappointment.Even at the 2018 Super Bowl, I was in a state of more or less constant terror. Right up until the last seconds, when Brady dropped back in the pocket to fling that Hail Mary, I was convinced we were going to lose.Partly that was because it was the Patriots -- because that's what they do to you -- and partly because it was the Eagles, because that's what we do to ourselves.When that ball bounced limply into the end zone, I can honestly say that only the joy I experienced at my wedding and the birth of my two children came close.We're an odd lot, Philly sports fans. We know that. We experience it all together. We say goodbye by saying ""Go birds"" these days. It's like the Hebrew word ""Shalom,"" which means hello and also goodbye and also peace. It has many meanings but all of them are positive. ""What's up, Jake? Go birds."" I get it, man.After the Super Bowl LII win, we sank back into a state of dissatisfying sadness. We lost both our quarterbacks. Both of them! The whole team broke up very quickly.It was weird to watch them so soon after that euphoria and see how many players I'd grown to love were no longer there. Personally, I would have stuck with Nick Foles, but of course, I didn't know Jalen Hurts was waiting around the corner. The fact that our incredible new quarterback's name is Hurts really says it all.Philadelphia fans have a bad reputation, that's not in dispute. It is a tough town that produces tough people: people who boo and throw snowballs at Santa, or scale traffic light poles or run drunkenly into pillars on subway platforms when we win.It's a bit stupid; I've been to various major league sports events in Boston, New York, Chicago and elsewhere, and I promise we don't have a monopoly on drunk, rude idiots. But I also don't mind if opposing teams and their fans find the Linc or Citizens Bank Park or the Wells Fargo Center intimidating places to enter; for my money, that's a good thing, especially if it helps us win.Yes, the origins of the 'No one likes us' song come from the English soccer club, Millwall -- no need to quote the sports version of Neil Kinnock and not footnote -- but some argue their fans are way more horrible than Eagles fans.There's still a sense of fun about our horribleness, and still a sense of pain that unites us, even if this is our second Super Bowl in five years.On Thursday, someone forwarded me a press release that an adult entertainment company sent out saying it was sending 1,500 gallons of cheese-flavored lube to grease the city's light poles to stop our fans from climbing them. I'm not sure what to think of that, but at least people are thinking about the Eagles. Perhaps, our presidential politics may have turned out differently if the adult entertainment industry had been thinking as prophylactically on other matters.So what about Sunday? I'm a professional skeptic and like many of my brothers and sisters in Phandom, I'm very superstitious. So I don't even want to talk about this Sunday. I don't want to jinx it.In fact, if the Gods of Fate are reading this, let me acknowledge that I know I deserve nothing and am expecting only pain. That's Philadelphia sports, and I wouldn't have it any other way."

He could now become the first Black quarterback in NFL history to win multiple Super Bowls. Meanwhile, Eagles quarterback Hurts could become the fourth Black quarterback to win the Lombardi Trophy if Philadelphia gets the better of the Chiefs on Sunday.""It's special,"" Mahomes said ahead of the game. ""I've learned more and more about the history of the Black quarterback since I've been in this league,"" the 27-year-old told reporters.""The guys that came before me and Jalen set the stage for this, and now I'm just glad we can set the stage for kids that are coming up now. It'll be a great game against two great teams and against another great quarterback. I'm excited to go out there and do what we can against a great team.""""I think it's history,"" Hurts said. ""I think it's something that's worthy of being noted and it is history. It's come a long way. I think it's only been seven African-American quarterbacks to play in the Super Bowl, so to be the first for something is pretty cool. I know it will be a good one.""This is a sentiment shared by Doug Williams, the first Black quarterback to start and win the Super Bowl in 1988.""I had tears of joy in my eye because I had an opportunity to witness this,"" Williams told TMZ. ""Sit there, and just look at it, and say to myself, 'Man, we got two Black quarterbacks playing in the Super Bowl,'"" he said, adding that he had similar feelings when Obama won the 2008 Presidential Election.Meanwhile, Eagles assistant coach Autumn Lockwood will be the first Black woman to coach in a Super Bowl, and the fourth woman to do so.""This is hugely important for a lot of people, especially Black people and women who were still not represented fully in the coaching ranks in the management ranks of the NFL,"" NFL Network's Chief National Reporter Steve Wyche told CNN Sport.A tale of two brothersThis year, in a rivalry so poignant it could be fiction, brothers Travis and Jason Kelce will face each other when the Chiefs and the Eagles meet at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on February 12. It is the first time in NFL history that two brothers play against each other in a Super Bowl.Both Chiefs tight end Travis and Eagles center Jason have had remarkably similar careers so far -- both attended Cleveland Heights High School and the University of Cincinnati, both have only played for just one team, and both have already won the Super Bowl -- Travis with the Chiefs in 2019 and Jason with the Eagles in 2017. The outcome of this game will surely give one brother major bragging rights.However, the siblings won't actually take to the field at the same time as they both play on offense -- Jason is an All-Pro center and Travis is an All-Pro tight end -- but it's still sure to be fiercely competitive. ""It's kind of great to see, these guys facing off, they're clearly very tight. They do a podcast together, they went to the same university to play before getting to the NFL,"" Wyche explained. ""You know, their teams will be squaring up against each other, they won't be going head to head, but to some degree, this is like Venus and Serena Williams playing against each other,"" he added.Wyche added that this game is bound to be special for the brothers, and especially for Jason Kelce, who is contemplating retirement.""This might be his last game he ever plays, because of his age, he's contemplating retirement before, to play against his brother in the ultimate game going in has to feel special. ""The tough part is when all is said and done, one of them is going to be very heartbroken. While the other one is going to be very ecstatic. ""A month from now, they'll be telling jokes about everything else. But in the immediate aftermath, there's going to be a mixed bag of emotions,"" he added.The mother of all games Jason and Travis' encounter won't just put the men in the firsts category -- their mom, Donna will officially become the first mother to have two sons play against each other in the Super Bowl, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.""They've already got the first win under their belts, so this is just going to be pure joy. We're going to really enjoy this, have a great time,"" she told the Today Show. ""Obviously, there's going to be somebody that's going to go home heartbroken. They won't have the bragging rights at the Thanksgiving table, but this is going to be an awesome event and I'm really looking forward to it.""Of course, another Super Bowl win would be nice for Jason -- but if it were to happen, it might not be the best thing to happen to him this month.His wife, Kylie, is pregnant -- and will be 38 weeks pregnant at the game, he said on his podcast, adding that her doctor will be traveling with her to the game, just in case. Pregnancy is considered full-term at 39 weeks, according to the the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. ""If she has the baby in the stadium, it's officially scripted,"" he said in conversation with his brother on his New Heights podcast. However, having a baby on the day of the Super Bowl would not be a first. Last year, while celebrating winning the Lombardi trophy on the field, Los Angeles Rams' wide receiver Van Jefferson found out his wife was in labor.""I was just overcome with so much joy, from just winning the Super Bowl, to finding out my wife was going to have our son,"" he told CNN at the time, adding that his wife attended as much of the game as possible until leaving ""until she couldn't anymore.""Asides from these firsts, Wyche added that this weekend's game is sure to be a spectacle. ""The Philadelphia Eagles spent this offseason gathering all of these really good players through trade and free agency. Whereas the Chiefs, they got rid of a couple of their best players in Tyrann Mathieu and Tyreek Hill and replaced them with young players who got their team back to a Super Bowl. It's just going to be such a fantastic game."""

174,Conservative activist Matt Schlapp denies sexual battery allegations in new court documents,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/politics/matt-schlapp-sexual-battery-lawsuit/index.html,"The documents claim the lawsuit, which seeks more than $9 million in damages from the Schlapps, ""reeks of gamesmanship and hypocrisy"" and say the accuser's request to remain anonymous ""is utterly without justification.""The Schlapps state the staffer's identity should be made public because they allege that his own reputation should be questioned, asserting that the staffer can't ""meet his burden of showing special circumstances which outweigh the public interest in knowing his name,"" according to the documents. ""Plaintiff simply cannot proceed on his claims of alleged impropriety by the Defendants while shielding from scrutiny his own past admitted unsavory affiliations with white nationalists and anti-Semites by proceeding as a 'John Doe,'"" the documents say.The initial complaint said the staffer, identified only as John Doe, faced an ""unusual risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm"" if he was named, based on the Schlapps' popularity and prominence.The Schlapps are now being represented by attorney Benjamin Chew, known for winning the defamation case against actor Johnny Depp. The 2022 trial, which saw a jury award Depp $15 million in his lawsuit against former wife Amber Heard, became known for airing many personal and intimate details publicly.The original lawsuit, filed in January, alleges that Schlapp, the president of the American Conservative Union, inappropriately fondled the genital area of a male Republican strategist during a car ride back to Schlapp's hotel in Atlanta last year.  Schlapp was in Georgia for Herschel Walker's Senate campaign and had spoken at an event earlier in the day. The staffer was assigned to drive Schlapp back to his hotel, and to another Walker event scheduled for the following morning.In addition to sexual battery allegations against Matt Schlapp, the lawsuit also accuses both Schlapps of defamation and conspiracy to discredit the staffer.Schlapp responseThe Schlapps' response to the lawsuit denies all claims of sexual battery and inappropriate touching but admits to phone calls and text messages exchanged between Matt Schlapp and the staffer, which have been previously reported and reviewed by CNN.The Schlapps admit to a text message in which Matt Schlapp suggests he and the staffer meet up for drinks, writing, ""I have a dinner at 7. May grab a beer after if you want to join let me know."" The staffer responds, ""I'd enjoy that,"" according to the documents.The Schlapps also admit to a phone call later the night of the alleged incident, to arrange pickup for the following morning, and a text message at 7:26 a.m. from Matt Schlapp to the staffer that said, ""I'm in the lobby,"" waiting for the staffer to drive him to the planned Walker event in Macon, Georgia.CNN previously reported that after the alleged sexual assault, the staffer notified Walker campaign officials, who told him not to drive Schlapp in the morning and to instead give him the phone number to a local car service.The staffer responded to Schlapp's text, saying, ""I did want to say I was uncomfortable with what happened last night. The campaign does have a driver who is available to get you to Macon and back to the airport,"" and provided the number. The Schlapps admit to this detail in the court documents and to three attempts Matt Schlapp made to call the staffer, which went unanswered.Several hours later, Matt Schlapp texted the staffer, ""If you could see it in your heart to call me at the end of day. I would appreciate it. If not I wish you luck on the campaign and hope you keep up the good work"" -- another exchange the Schlapps admit to in the documents.As part of the defamation count in the original lawsuit, the complaint claimed that Mercedes Schlapp sent a message to a neighborhood group text that smeared the staffer's character and claimed he'd been fired from jobs for ""lying and lying on his resume."" The Schlapps deny that allegation in their response.The Schlapps are requesting the court dismiss the complaint. A preliminary hearing on whether the staffer should be identified is set for March 8 in Alexandria Circuit Court in Virginia. The staffer and his attorney declined to provide further comment."
175,Harvey Weinstein sued by woman who he was convicted of raping in Los Angeles criminal trial,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/us/harvey-weinstein-civil-lawsuit/index.html,"The model and actress, who is identified as Jane Doe 1 in court documents, was the first to testify in Weinstein's Los Angeles trial in 2022.  The three charges Weinstein was convicted of last December -- rape, sexual penetration by a foreign object and forcible oral copulation -- were all tied to Jane Doe 1, who testified the movie mogul assaulted her in a Beverly Hills hotel room in 2013.  But the jury deadlocked on the alleged aggravating factors attached to the charges, which could have increased his sentence and the judge declared a mistrial on those allegations. Weinstein is set to be sentenced on February 23, at which time the judge will consider a motion from defense attorneys asking for a new trial. The new lawsuit, filed February 9 in the Superior Court of California for Los Angeles County, alleges Weinstein met Jane Doe 1 briefly at a film festival and then showed up at her hotel room later that evening and assaulted her in February 2013. The plaintiff is suing Weinstein for sexual battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence. She is also seeking an undisclosed amount in punitive and other damages.  ""Harvey has always denied the allegations, and even more, has maintained that he was never together with her in Mr. Cs hotel at all and that these events never happened. Certain witnesses lied about crucial evidence that could have exonerated Mr. Weinstein, and it was deemed unnecessary by the court for the jury to hear or know about these facts,"" Juda Engelmayer, a representative for Weinstein, told CNN in a statement.Engelmayer added that Weinstein's attorneys have ""submitted a motion detailing those facts and contend that the jury would not have convicted him had they known the specifics...""  The assault happened after Weinstein allegedly showed up at the hotel and asked a front desk staffer to connect him with the victim, the lawsuit said. After the front desk called Jane Doe, Weinstein ended up talking on the phone with the victim and asked her for her room number. She declined to offer her room number and hung up. Minutes later, Weinstein showed up outside her room, and when the woman refused to let him inside, he ""bullied his way into her room,"" the lawsuit says.  ""Once in the room, he engaged in small talk with Plaintiff but in an arrogant and intimidating manner. He quickly made his real intentions clear. He wanted to have sex with her,"" the lawsuit says. ""He sat on her bed and then forcibly grabbed Plaintiff and made her sit down next to him."" After telling her that she was ""pretty,"" he commented on her breasts and ""grabbed"" at them, the lawsuit says. Jane Doe repeatedly asked Weinstein to leave her hotel room, but he ignored her and became aggressive verbally and physically, according to the lawsuit. ""He then forced Plaintiff to orally copulate him and then he forcibly moved her into the bathroom, where he blocked her from leaving and then raped her,"" the lawsuit says. ""After he was done raping her, he acted as if nothing out of the ordinary happened, and left."" California law allows adult victims of sexual assault to file a civil action within ten years of the alleged assault and within one year of the defendant being convicted of a felony, according to the lawsuit.  The victim's attorney, Dave Ring, said in a statement to CNN that they ""look forward to have Weinstein finally testify under oath in this case."" ""Harvey Weinstein has been convicted of raping Jane Doe 1,"" Ring said. ""Her lawsuit seeks to recover compensation from him for the horrific rape she endured and all of the issues she has suffered through for the past ten years because of that rape."" "

I cannot pursue this case out of political convenience. Given the conflicts that have arisen, the evidentiary problems, and the complete lack of good faith surrounding the filing of this matter, we cannot ethically proceed with this prosecution,"" Jenkins states in the letter. ""Therefore, it is our intention to dismiss the charges made in this case, unless the Attorney General's Office decides to step in and take over the case."" Jenkins indicated in the letter that she intends to drop the charges against Samayoa at a March 1st hearing.In a statement to CNN, former San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin said, ""It's clear Jenkins has been coordinating with the officer's defense team to avoid a public hearing on the disturbing facts of the case."" Boudin goes on to say Jenkins ""is scapegoating me to try to divert attention from what this decision ultimately reveals about her: Jenkins will not hold everyone equally accountable under the law, she is deeply politically motivated, and she does not care about victims of police violence.""O'Neil's family has requested the prosecution to continue.""The decision of Brooke Jenkins to dismiss this case simply proves the conflict we complained of: She is more interested in protecting murderous cops and attacking Boudin than in seeking justice for the citizens of San Francisco. It is a shameful and cowardly decision. But it means that Attorney General Rob Bonta has all the more duty to investigate and take up the prosecution of Christopher Samayoa for the murder of Keita O'Neil,"" said Brian Ford, attorney for O'Neil's aunt, April Green.Bonta's office told CNN they have received the request and are reviewing it.Samayoa was a rookie cop just four days into his tenure with the department on the day of the shooting. He was fired from the force in March 2018 after the deadly incident. ""Chesa Boudin's filing of this case was irresponsible, reckless and motivated by what I believe to be blind political aspirations; attempting to make my client his professional deer-head with no consideration for prosecutorial integrity,"" Samayoa's attorney, Julia Fox, said in a statement. ""Conversely, Brooke Jenkins and her Managing Attorney Darby Williams have been thoughtful and conscientious in their analysis of this political hot potato that was senselessly dropped in their laps."""
180,Latest Supreme Court-related ruling overturning gun regulations worries domestic violence survivor advocates,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/politics/domestic-abuse-guns-5th-circuit-supreme-court/index.html,"Earlier this month, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals said that those under domestic violence restraining orders have a Second Amendment right to bear arms, saying a federal law barring those alleged abusers from possessing guns is unconstitutional. The risk of homicide in a domestic violence situation increases by 500% if a gun is present, according to research cited by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Though some of the states covered by the appeals court have similar state law restrictions, the new ruling undermines a crucial tool that survivors have in protecting themselves from their abusers. If the 5th Circuit's logic was adopted nationwide by the US Supreme Court, the consequences would be devastating, advocates say.""People are going to know that their abuser still has their gun. They're going continue to live in absolute, abject fear,"" said Heather Bellino, the CEO of the Texas Advocacy Project, which works with victims of domestic violence. ""They are going to be afraid to get a protective order, because now that gun's not going away, and now [the abuser is] real pissed. So, it's going to have an absolute chilling effect on survivors."" Guns are used to commit nearly two-thirds of intimate partner homicides, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. A 2021 study found that the majority of mass shootings are also linked to domestic violence. ""There's a clear connection between intimate partner homicide and the accessibility of firearms,"" said Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. ""And not just to murder partners, but abusers use guns or even the mere presence of a gun to coerce, threaten and terrorize their victims of all genders.""The ruling only applies in the circuit -- which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi -- and, for now, doesn't affect the similar state laws that two of those three states have on the books. The 5th Circuit said the federal law is unconstitutional because it lacked an adequate parallel to the firearm regulations that were in place at the time of Constitution's framing. That historical test was laid out in a blockbuster US Supreme Court opinion last year that has since led lower courts to knock down various kinds of state and federal gun restrictions across the country. Attorney General Merrick Garland has signaled the Justice Department will appeal the 5th Circuit's ruling.'A control mechanism' The federal law in question was passed in 1996. Several states have similar prohibitions, though if the Supreme Court were to agree with the 5th Circuit's reasoning, they, too, would be unconstitutional, according to Roskam.Unlike some of the state laws that restrict the access those under domestic violence protective order have to firearms, the federal law does not lay out a specific process for forcing an alleged abuser to turn over his weapons once he is placed under a protective order. However, some local jurisdictions have used the federal law to implement such procedures, according to Julia Weber, director of the National Center on Gun Violence in Relationships at the Battered Women's Justice Project.That makes the federal law a critical tool for urging survivors to leave their abusive situations, advocates say, even if the law's enforcement has been inconsistent across the country. ""In Texas, taking away somebody's gun is not easy ... it shouldn't be super easy,"" Bellino said. ""But we were always able to say, 'federal law trumps state law, so guess what? You're going get rid of your gun.' And in as many cases as possible, we made that happen."" According to experts and advocates who have worked directly with survivors, abusers can use guns to make explicit threats of violence against their victims and also wield their weapons in lower-key ways that are implicit acts of intimidation. Ruth Glenn, a domestic violence survivor who was shot by her estranged spouse, recalled to CNN how simply being aware that her abuser owned a firearm made her fearful -- even when he wasn't actively wielding it against her.""The entire idea that there was always a threat and knowing that the firearm was there, was such a control mechanism,"" said Glenn, who is now president of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. When a victim decides to come forward and seek a court's intervention, it is a particularly vulnerable time for her, advocates say, and victims feel safer when protective orders come with a two-prong effect of both keeping their abuser away and depriving of them of a lethal weapon. ""This timeframe when they're accessing that order of protection is so critical,"" said Monica McLaughlin, the senior director of public policy at the National Network to End Domestic Violence.  ""So, the ability to remove firearms at that time, we think, is one of the most critical components to a survivor's safety."" What happens next In the short term, the 5th Circuit's ruling wiped away the conviction of a defendant who challenged his prosecution under the federal law. As long as that ruling is in effect, federal prosecutors will be unable to bring charges under the federal law within the circuit. Others who have been convicted under the federal law within the 5th Circuit may also ask that the courts throw out those convictions under the appeals court ruling that the law in question is unconstitutional. The 5th Circuit ruling does not apply to states in other federal circuits. Nor does it block the enforcement of state laws in the 5th Circuit targeted at those accused of domestic abuse -- though those laws might soon see court challenges citing the 5th Circuit's opinion. Texas law bars the those under a protective order from possessing firearms but has only limited mechanisms for forcing the surrender of a gun -- and only once a permanent order is issued. Louisiana's prohibitions create a firearm removal process once a permanent injunction against an abuser is obtained. The third state within the circuit, Mississippi, has no state law restricting firearm ownership by those under domestic violence protective orders, according to Disarm Domestic Violence, which tracks state and federal policy on the issue.What happens next in the case could have broader consequences for domestic abuse victims. The case could potentially land in front of the Supreme Court and if the high court adopts the 5th Circuit's reasoning, it will control nationwide. ""People have to make choices about whether they come forward and where they go for help,"" said Weber, of the Battered Women's Justice Project. ""And they're not going to go to our courts, or reach out to law enforcement, or even perhaps reach out to community-based organizations, if they don't think the risks that they're living with will be taken seriously.""

""If anyone is experiencing watery eyes, burning eyes, irritation of the nose or throat, difficulty breathing, we are asking that you proceed to the nearest emergency center to seek care,"" Dr. Ericka Brown, director of Harris County Public Health's community health and wellness division, said earlier Sunday. The county health department tweeted the areas affected by the shelter-in-place advisory.What is anhydrous ammonia?Anhydrous ammonia is a pungent gas with suffocating fumes that is used as a fertilizer, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Anhydrous means ""without water."" If anhydrous ammonia combines with water in the human body, it can cause rapid dehydration and severe burns. ""There is no antidote for ammonia toxicity,"" the CDC's website says. Symptoms of anhydrous ammonia exposure include breathing difficulty; irritation of the eyes, nose or throat; burns or blisters.Those who get anhydrous ammonia in the eyes should wash the eyes with large amounts of water for 15 minutes. Exposure to high concentrations of anhydrous ammonia can lead to death. As of Sunday morning, no injuries had been reported in connection with the leak, the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office tweeted. The cause of the leak was not immediately clear.CNN has reached out to the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office, the Texas Department of State Health Services and the Harris County Sheriff's Office for more information.

184,Rick Scott: From embattled health care executive to Biden's top foil,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/rick-scott-medicare-florida-biden/index.html,"As a spending fight looms in Washington and Biden moves toward his 2024 reelection bid, the White House is attempting to make Scott the poster child for the president's accusations that Republicans are seeking to cut entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicare.Scott has responded by accusing Biden of lying, airing a misleading ad that alleges Biden cut Medicare and lambasting the president in a barrage of television interviews.Biden traveled Thursday to Florida -- where Scott was a health care executive and two-term governor -- on the latest leg of his post-State of the Union tour.The trip was designed in part to stoke a fight with Scott after Biden in his speech Tuesday night seized on the first-term senator's proposal to sunset all federal programs -- including Social Security and Medicare -- every five years unless Congress extends those programs.Biden's assertion that some Republicans are seeking to change entitlement programs was met with jeers from Republican lawmakers, who have said spending cuts should be part of any proposal to raise the debt ceiling.The president continued pressing that message Wednesday in Wisconsin, telling union workers, ""A lot of Republicans, their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare."" He waved a pamphlet with Scott's proposal as he spoke.Ahead of Biden's speech Thursday in Tampa, White House aides placed copies of Scott's proposal on every seat.In an interview with CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Thursday, Scott said Biden has misrepresented the proposal he put forward ahead of the 2022 midterm elections while serving as head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate GOP. ""Nobody believes that I want to cut Medicare or Social Security. I've never said it,"" Scott said.Scott said his proposal is intended to eliminate wasteful spending and help ensure the government can ""figure out how to start living within our means.""""I want to make sure we balance our budget and preserve Medicare and Social Security, and I've been clear all along. So what I want to do is get rid of wasteful programs that we never review up here,"" he said.But Scott's proposal would sunset all federal legislation -- including the two entitlement programs -- every five years and require Congress to pass them again.Scott's heath care pastLong before he was a US senator, Scott had first-hand experience dealing with America's federal health care programs -- and it became the source of much criticism as he entered the political arena.In the 1980s, Scott founded Columbia Hospital Corporation by purchasing a pair of distressed Texas hospitals. He later merged his company with Hospital Corporation of America to create Columbia/HCA, becoming the largest for-profit hospital chain at the time and gaining notoriety on Wall Street for what appeared like cost-cutting in an industry with ballooning expenses. In 1997, federal agents unveiled a sweeping investigation into Columbia/HCA that would roil the company for years. On the day the FBI swooped in to seize records from 35 of its hospitals across six states, Scott shrugged off the probe. ""It's not a fun day, but ... government investigations are a matter of fact today in health care,"" he said on CNN.The investigation would unearth what the US Department of Justice later called the ""largest health care fraud case in U.S. history."" According to a press release, Columbia/HCA schemed to defraud Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE, the military's health care program, of hundreds of millions of dollars. The company pleaded guilty to criminal conduct, including charges related to fraudulent Medicare billing and paying kickbacks to doctors, and it ultimately agreed to pay $1.7 billion in fines, damages and penalties.Scott was pushed out as CEO amid the turmoil. He was never charged with a crime, though much of the alleged financial abuses took place during his watch. His time in the corporate world made Scott a wealthy individual, which he would lean on in 2010 when he decided to kickstart a political career by entering the race for Florida governor.Scott's time at the helm of Columbia/HCA was the subject of negative ads from both Republicans and Democrats, but he fended them off with a self-funded campaign that flooded the airwaves with a jobs-focused message. He told the St. Petersburg Times that ""mistakes were made"" at his former company and that he had ""learned hard lessons,"" but he also said during a debate that he was ""proud of the company I built."" Regardless of the controversy, the little-known Scott defeated a GOP favorite for his party's nomination, and Floridians narrowly elected him governor that fall.During his eight years leading Florida, Scott fought off attempts to extend safety net benefits to Floridians. He frequently challenged the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act and blocked expansion of Medicaid in Florida. In his first year as governor, he signed a bill to cut unemployment payments and tied benefits to the state's unemployment rate. Democrats continued to make Scott's time at Columbia/HCA an issue, to no avail. Scott eked out a reelection victory in 2014. He then narrowly unseated longtime Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in 2018 after spending more than $70 million of his own money on his campaign.Marching to the beat of his own drum, Scott declined to be sworn in with his class in January 2019. Instead, he waited until his term as governor had ended and flew to Washington for a separate ceremony. For a time, it made him the country's most junior senator, but he nevertheless soon found himself in party leadership. Scott's frosty relationship with McConnellScott and other Republicans are aggressively pushing back against Biden's assertions that the GOP is seeking to cut spending on entitlement programs.However, Republican leaders have long recognized Scott's proposal to sunset all federal programs after five years as rocky political terrain.The tense relationship between Scott and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell burst into public view during the 2022 election cycle as Republicans sought to retake the Senate.  Scott, as NRSC chairman, released a platform called ""Rescue America,"" which would have subjected all federally elected officials to a term limit of 12 years and closed the Department of Education, amid a slew of other initiatives. It would also have required millions of low-income and middle-class Americans to pay income taxes, which was later dropped in a revised version of the plan. And, in what Democrats immediately recognized as an opening to accuse Republicans of attempting to undercut popular programs, Scott's plan proposed sunsetting all federal legislation in five years -- unless Congress extended it.McConnell quickly disavowed Scott's plan, seeking to make clear that the Florida senator did not speak for Senate Republicans.""Let me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda,"" McConnell said at a news conference last March. ""We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.""Their frosty relationship did not improve as the 2022 election cycle continued, as the two battled over which candidates to support in primaries and in the general election, and Republicans ultimately fell short of winning a majority.After the election, Scott challenged McConnell for the top Senate Republican post but lost.The Florida senator said last week that he saw McConnell's decision to remove him from the Senate Commerce Committee as retribution.""He didn't like that I opposed him because I believe we have to have ideas -- fight over ideas,"" Scott said on ""CNN This Morning.""Scott points to 1975 Biden proposalWhen pressed Thursday by CNN's Collins about why his proposal left open the opportunity for the government to cut funding for Social Security and Medicare, Scott repeatedly referenced a policy proposal from then-Sen. Biden in 1975 to sunset federal legislation periodically.Scott said Biden's old proposal does less to protect entitlements for seniors than the senator's plan from last year because ""he proposed it year after year after year to reduce Medicare and Social Security. Year after year. I've never done that. I don't believe in that.""Asked Thursday about the 1975 proposal mentioned by Scott, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""A bill from the 1970s is not part of the president's agenda.""""The president ran on protecting Medicare and Social Security from cuts. And he reiterated that in the State of the Union,"" she said.A new ad from Scott released this week in advance of the president's visit to Florida says that ""Joe Biden just cut $280 billion from Medicare"" -- a claim that was previously debunked when Scott and the NRSC made it in 2022.Biden's Inflation Reduction Act is expected to reduce Medicare prescription drug spending by the federal government by $237 billion, according to the most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate, because the law allows the government to spend less money to buy drugs from pharmaceutical companies and not because it cuts benefits to seniors enrolled in Medicare. The law makes Medicare's prescription drug program substantially more generous to seniors while also saving them money.Scott, in his interview with Collins, also defended his recent call for Biden to resign, labeling him ""a complete failure."" He said his resignation calls did not specifically stem from Biden's use of his proposal as an avenue to attack Republicans but expressed his displeasure with the president's repeated references to his plan.""He lies about what I want to get done, and I don't appreciate it,"" Scott said."
185,Washington forges rare political unity in condemning China over balloon drama,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/washington-unity-china-balloon/index.html,"The coming together of Republicans and Democrats is certain to stiffen future US strategic, economic and military resolve in the Pacific region and further damage buckled relations with Beijing. The fierce congressional reaction to the balloon and the US government's disclosure of intelligence about it and China's balloon espionage program, meanwhile, threatened to further damage the world's most crucial diplomatic relationship -- especially after China hit back by accusing the US of being the world's most gratuitous spy state.The unanimity of American anger toward China was exemplified by a House resolution condemning China that passed by a stunning 419-0 margin. It followed a growing realization in Washington, and more broadly across the country, that a long-predicted geopolitical confrontation may now be a reality. But despite the united political front in Washington, fury is boiling in both parties over the failure to down the balloon before it traversed the continent amid rising questions about the implications of China's breach of US airspace. Administration officials faced a gauntlet of criticism from lawmakers during a classified briefing on the issue on Thursday. And Republicans stepped up efforts to brand President Joe Biden as weak over the incursion despite his warning to President Xi Jinping in his State of the Union address earlier this week that he would vigorously defend US sovereignty. This growing discord threatens to so politicize China policy that it will drain any efforts to defuse an escalating Cold War. The Biden administration wants to pursue those efforts despite the tensions caused by the balloon crisis.There's also a risk that Republican efforts to leverage the drama for domestic political gain could bust unity over policy toward America's giant Pacific rival. Such a partisan split would ironically deliver a greater payoff for China's communist rulers than any information picked up by the balloon over the US.The House speaks with one voice -- but it might not last longThe unanimous House vote on the incident had not been assured. It required Republican leaders to omit language critical of Biden and followed unusual bipartisan cooperation fostered by Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the top Democrat on the panel, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks. The resolution describes the balloon flight as a brazen violation of US sovereignty. McCaul said the bipartisan nature of the vote was critical and called on everyone to stand together against a ""common enemy.""""We wanted it to be America against China -- not internal fighting, because China would see that as a moment of weakness, that we're divided on party lines, and we didn't want to project that,"" McCaul told CNN. This strong signal sent to Beijing raises the possibility that the spy balloon mission has demonstrably hurt China's interests -- especially if it results in a bipartisan zeal to increase defense spending, the size of US arms and equipment packages to allow Taiwan to defend against a possible Chinese attack and more resources to US allies.Anger in Congress over balloon's flight While there is agreement on the challenge now posed by China, there was mystification and some anger elsewhere in Congress on Thursday, even as officials held classified briefings and the FBI pushed forward on its effort to evaluate intelligence from the remains of the balloon salvaged from the Atlantic after it was shot down on Saturday.In a Senate hearing, Democrats as well as Republicans, criticized Defense Department officials and questioned why they did not tell Americans more once the balloon was spotted.""You guys have to help me understand why this baby wasn't taken out long before,"" said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who could be facing a tough reelection next year. The balloon floated above his state, which hosts US missile installations. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was furious that the Chinese balloon crossed her state. ""As an Alaskan, I am so angry,"" Murkowski said. ""If you're going to have Russia coming at you, if you're going to have China coming at you, we know exactly how they come. They come up and they go over Alaska.""Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, said he understood why the White House might have kept China's balloon program classified but added, ""We all understand that some of the desire to keep things classified, it has to do with not wanting to disclose to the public things that might be inconvenient politically for the department."" The White House has previously explained that it waited until the balloon was off the Carolinas to shoot it down based on Pentagon advice that doing so before could endanger lives and property on the ground. Officials also said they took steps to ensure it was not an intelligence threat as it wafted across the country.But some Republicans are accusing the White House of a cover-up that they think exposes Biden as feckless and unfit to be commander-in-chief as he eyes reelection, despite his strong role in standing up to Russia over Ukraine.""I think the public, and Congress, would never have known about this if the Billings, Montana, paper hadn't published a picture that showed the balloon and US assets tracking the balloon. I think their plan was clearly to keep this a secret,"" Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley told CNN after a classified briefing.""The United States was grossly unprepared, this administration was grossly unprepared, and frankly I think it was a huge mistake for them not to take down the balloon before it entered the continental United States,"" Hawley added. While the House vote on the resolution condemning China was unanimous, many Republicans used the debate before the resolution passed to lacerate the Biden administration.""We watched in real time from our backyards and workplaces as a foreign aircraft equipped with spyware navigated over our neighborhoods, our military installations and our vital infrastructure,"" said Missouri GOP Rep. Ann Wagner, the vice chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.""The administration again showed the dictatorship in Beijing that they could again be bullied. President Biden's weakness and indecision sends a dangerous signal to our adversaries like Iran and Russia and North Korea.""Still, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney said he came away from the classified briefing more confident in the administration.""I believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care,"" Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said.Top US official: Xi has changed the gameBesides the classified briefings, Biden administration officials divulged new information about the balloon to the public Thursday, some of it gleaned by flybys by U-2 spy planes before it was downed. A senior State Department official said the balloon had been capable of conducting signals intelligence collection -- or intelligence gathered by electronic means -- and was part of a fleet that had flown over ""more than 40 countries across five continents."" Beijing is likely to be irked by more details being made public about its balloon program, as evidenced by comments by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning in a briefing Thursday. ""I am not aware of any 'fleet of balloons,'"" Mao said. ""That narrative is probably part of the information and public opinion warfare the US has waged on China. As to who is the world's number one country of spying, eavesdropping and surveillance, that is plainly visible to the international community,"" she added.Lawmakers were told Thursday that the order to send the balloon was dispatched without Xi's knowledge, sources familiar with Hill briefings said. But the idea Xi was unaware of balloon ""is the working theory and an ongoing intelligence gap,"" a source briefed on the matter said.Intelligence experts in the United States have been perplexed at the political furor stoked by a mere balloon -- a comparatively unsophisticated asset that pales in significance compared to multi-pronged Chinese intelligence operations against the United States including economic, cyber and traditional espionage. Indeed, the US mounts a similarly broad collection mission against China, which was exposed when a Chinese jet fighter collided with a US spy plane in international airspace over the South China Sea in 2001. But the balloon flight, over US territory, has had a symbolic impact greater than that so far generated amid years of building tensions with China, including over Taiwan. ""I would never have imagined that my Saturday afternoon would have been disrupted due to a Chinese spy balloon not -- only that floated across most of South Carolina, it floated across the entire continental United States,"" said freshman Republican Rep. Russell Fry whose South Carolina district contains coastal areas where the balloon was shot down.""It does -- if you watch it, and you were there on the ground -- sound like it was straight out of a sci-fi movie,"" he said on the House floor, blasting the Biden administration for negligence and bemoaning an international incident that unfolded off the shores of Myrtle Beach.In the Senate, the dramatic events of the past week have caused a reassessment of years of US-China policy, which has seen efforts by the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations to try to usher China peacefully into the global economy degenerate into a brewing confrontation in the Trump and Biden administrations.Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said at a hearing that the Biden administration did not ""see another Cold War, but we do ask everyone to play by the same set of rules."" The problem, however, is that China interprets such US calls as an attempt to thwart what it sees as its rightful rise as a regional and global superpower. Sherman argued that US policy in the 21st century designed to head off confrontation had not failed, but that conditions in China had changed.""Xi Jinping is not the Xi Jinping of the 1990's that we all thought we knew,"" Sherman told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. She added that China under Xi was ""the only country that wants to change that rules-based order, that can successfully do so and are trying to make that happen."" ""It is true that our way of life, our democracy, our belief in our values, in the rules-based international order is being challenged,"" she continued. ""And we have to meet that challenge."""

188,Here is what we know about the unidentified objects shot down over North America,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/politics/unidentified-object-canada-alaska-military-latest/index.html,"On Saturday, an unidentified object was downed over northern Canada, a day after another object had been shot down over Alaska airspace by a US F-22. Last weekend, a Chinese surveillance balloon was taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina.There's no indication at this point that the unidentified objects have any connection to China's surveillance balloon, but it seems that national security officials across the continent remain on edge. Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said Sunday that the operation to down the object near Lake Huron was carried out by pilots from the US Air Force and the National Guard. CNN initially reported that the object was shot down over Lake Huron based on what sources said to CNN and a public tweet by Republican Rep. Jack Bergman of Michigan.The object was first detected by the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the US Northern Command over Montana on Saturday night, and fighter aircraft were sent to investigate, a senior administration official told CNN. At the time, those planes did not identify any object to correlate to the radar hits, which led NORAD and NORTHCOM to believe it was an anomaly.But on Sunday, defense officials reacquired the radar contact and detected the object flying over Wisconsin and then Michigan. The path of the object and its altitude raised concerns that it could pose a threat to civilian aircraft, but it did not pose a military threat to anyone on the ground, the official said. President Joe Biden ordered the object to be shot down. Here's what we know so far:Description of objectsPrior to the takedown of the object near Lake Huron, a US official said Sunday there had been caution inside the Biden administration on the pilot descriptions of the unidentified objects shot down over Alaska and Canada due to the circumstances in which the objects were viewed.""These objects did not closely resemble and were much smaller than the PRC balloon and we will not definitively characterize them until we can recover the debris, which we are working on,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said, referring to the suspected Chinese spy balloon.Earlier Sunday, Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh also noted the difference between the incidents. ""These objects shot down on Friday and Saturday were objects and did not closely resemble the PRC balloon. When we can recover the debris, we will have more for you,"" she said Sunday Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABC News on Sunday morning that he was briefed by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and that the object shot down over Canada was likely another balloon -- as was the high-altitude object downed over Alaska on Friday.On Saturday, Canada's chief of defense staff, Gen. Wayne Eyre, also made mention of a ""balloon"" when describing instructions given to the team that worked to take down the object.'A cylindrical object'The unidentified object that was shot down in Canadian airspace had been tracked since Friday evening, according to a statement from Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder.The object was detected by NORAD, and two F-22 fighter jets from Joint Base Elemendorf-Richardson, Alaska, were sent up to monitor the object with the help of the Alaska Air National Guard.The object appears to be a ""cylindrical object"" smaller than the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down previously, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said at a news conference on Saturday.""Monitoring continued today as the object crossed into Canadian airspace, with Canadian CF-18 and CP-140 aircraft joining the formation to further assess the object,"" Ryder's statement said.Eyre said Saturday that ""the instructions that were given to the the team was whoever had the first best shot to take out the balloon had to go ahead.""US President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both approved the shoot-down on Saturday, according to a statement from the White House.""President Biden authorized US fighter aircraft assigned to NORAD to conduct the operation and a US F-22 shot down the object in Canadian territory in close coordination with Canadian authorities,"" the White House statement said. ""The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.""The object was shot down with a AIM-9X missile from a US F-22 -- the same missile and aircraft that shot down an unidentified object on Friday, and the Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4.""The object was flying at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, had unlawfully entered Canadian airspace and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight. The object was shot down approximately 100 miles from the Canada-United States border over Canadian territory in central Yukon,"" she said.Ryder's statement said that while Canadian authorities conduct recovery operations, the FBI will be ""working closely with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.""The fourth such shoot-down for US aircraft in just over a week Sunday's takedown of the unidentified object near Lake Huron marks the fourth such incident in just over week.On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down by a US F-22 over Alaskan airspace after it had been monitored by the US since Thursday evening.Pilots gave different accounts of what they observed after coming near the object, a source briefed on the intelligence told CNN; some pilots said it ""interfered with their sensors,"" but other pilots said they didn't experience that.The object was flying at 40,000 feet, which made it a risk to civilian traffic. That set it apart from the Chinese surveillance balloon, which was traveling ""well above commercial air traffic,"" Ryder said at the time.Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska said Friday, after the unidentified object was shot down over his state, that similar objects have been spotted over Alaska in recent weeks, the Alaska Beacon reported.""There were things that were seen on radar but weren't explained,"" the Senate Armed Services Committee member told the publication.The Chinese balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina last Saturday after traveling across the US. Biden administration officials said it posed little intelligence gathering and military risk.It did, however, pose a risk to people and property on the ground if it were to be shot down, as officials said it was roughly 200 feet tall and the payload weighed more than a couple of thousand pounds.The US military is still working to recover debris from the balloon on the ocean floor. Ryder said Friday that they have ""located a significant amount of debris so far that will prove helpful to our further understanding of this balloon and its surveillance capabilities.""Notably, the US intelligence community's method to track China's fleet of surveillance balloons was only discovered within the last year, six people familiar with the matter told CNN.The findings have allowed the US to develop a consistent technical method for the first time, which they have used to track the balloons in near-real time across the globe, the sources said.Congress reactsEarlier Sunday, before the shooting down of the object near Lake Huron, lawmakers on Capitol Hill offered a range of responses to the recent developments.  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner told CNN that the Biden administration does appear ""somewhat trigger-happy"" in how it dealt with objects over the weekend after allowing the first spotted balloon to fly across the country.""What I think this shows, which is probably more important to our policy discussion here, is that we really have to declare that we're going to defend our airspace. And then we need to invest,"" the Ohio Republican added. ""This shows some of the problems and gaps that we have. We need to fill those as soon as possible because we certainly now ascertain there is a threat.""Turner's Democratic counterpart on the Intelligence panel, Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he had ""real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows,"" before adding, ""My guess is that there's just not a lot of information out there to share.""Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, said Congress needs to investigate why it took so long for the US to catch on to the Chinese government's use of spy balloons.""I do think (Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana) is looking into why it took so long for us, our military, our intelligence, to know about these balloons. That's something I support. Congress should look at that. That's the question we have to answer,"" he said. ""I think our military, our intelligence are doing a great job, present and future. I feel a lot of confidence in what they're doing. But why, as far back as the Trump administration, did no one know about this?""Also Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he remains unconvinced by assertions from the intelligence community that he suspected Chinese spy balloon did not seriously damage US national security during its flight across the country.""They say they mitigated it, but my assessment -- and I can't get into the detail of the intelligence document -- is that if it was still transmitting, going over these three very sensitive nuclear sites, I think if you look at the flight pattern of the balloon, it tells a story as to what the Chinese were up to, as they controlled this aircraft throughout the United States,"" the Texas Republican told CBS News. This story has been updated with additional information."

Her victory cemented Whitmer's place -- two years after she was a finalist for Biden's vice presidential pick -- as a leading figure within the Democratic Party. And it demonstrates the limits of voters' willingness to punish officials in competitive states who took strict measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including school and business closures.  Still, Whitmer has repeatedly brushed off speculation about her political future beyond her current role. ""I think doing my job well is the best way that I can contribute to the national Democratic Party -- is to be able to be someone that they can point to and say, 'This is what happens when you elect Democrats,'"" she told CNN last month, reflecting on how her 2022 campaign ""talked about abortion in the most personal terms"" and how she thinks that contributed to Democrats' success."

191,Watch 122 rescue dogs face off in this year's Puppy Bowl,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/sport/puppy-bowl-time-lineup-adoption-trnd/index.html,"That's right: It's time for Puppy Bowl XIX.The annual televised event, produced by Animal Planet, will air on Sunday afternoon before the big game. Here's everything you need to know about the pup-ular tournament.How the game worksLike the Super Bowl, the Puppy Bowl will also feature two teams: Team Ruff (sporting orange bandanas) and Team Fluff (wearing blue). The canine athletes will face off for the Chewy ""Lombarky"" trophy.And if you can't tell the difference between a touchdown and a field goal, don't worry. The rules of the Puppy Bowl are a lot simpler than football. The pups will roam a mini football stadium decked out with chew toys and try to get a ball into one of two end zones.Dan Schachner will serve as the game's ""ruff-eree"" for the 12th year and sportscasters Taylor Rooks and Steve Levy will provide expert commentary on the puppies' valiant efforts. Other beloved highlights of the game include the water bowl cam and the Pedigree puppy kiss cam.The game helps rescue pups find 'furever' homesIn addition to serving as adorable entertainment, the game also has a higher purpose. Every furry athlete is a rescue dog, and some are still waiting to be adopted from a shelter or foster home. The competition helps draw much-needed attention to the pups and the shelters that take care of them.""We really couldn't ask for a better platform,"" Chrissy Beckles, founder and president of The Sato Project, a non-profit that rescues abused and abandoned dogs in Puerto Rico and rehomes them on the US mainland, previously told CNN. ""I can't think of a single negative for this -- only that it's only once a year.""Rescue groups spend months making sure the dogs are socialized and acclimated to the bright lights and loud noises they encounter while filming.Interested adopters can reach out to the shelter directly via Animal Planet's website. If a certain player catches your eye, however, keep in mind they might have already been adopted. The Puppy Bowl is pretaped, so some of the dogs have already been placed with families. But others still need homes. And even if the pup you like has been adopted, the shelter might be able to recommend another dog for your home.Animal Planet says every puppy and kitten ever featured on prior Puppy Bowls has found a home since the first show in 2005.Dozens of fur babies will competeThis year, a total of 122 puppies from 67 shelters and rescue organizations across the United States and the Caribbean will face off in the Puppy Bowl. Pictures of each athlete are listed on Animal Planet's website, with details about their breed, background, and the shelter where they live.This is the first time a Native American animal rescue organization has been represented at the Puppy Bowl, according to a news release from Warner Bros. Discovery. And it's the first time a pup from Dominica, the West Indies has competed in the epic showdown.The game will also feature eleven dogs with special needs, including Julius, a hearing-impaired Dalmatian, and Marmalade, a sight- and hearing-impaired border collie/Australian cattle dog mix, according to the news release.A 'purrfect' halftime showIf you're more of a cat person, you'll want to tune in for the halftime show. Before Rihanna takes the stage for the Super Bowl's halftime show, adoptable kittens will take to the turf for their own midgame performance.How to watch the big gameThe pup-tastic festivities will kick off with a pregame show airing at 1 p.m. ET on Animal Planet, Discovery Channel, and TBS. It'll also stream on Discovery+ and HBO Max. This pregame portion will feature interviews with coaches and players and details about each pup's breed mix, according to the news release.The real game will air from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET, with profiles on the adoptable pets airing in between shots of the game itself.And no matter which team takes home the trophy, one thing's for sure: Every pup's a winner.Disclosure: Animal Planet and CNN are both owned by Warner Bros.

192,Trump attorney appeared before federal grand jury in Mar-a-Lago probe,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/evan-corcoran-trump-attorney-grand-jury-mar-a-lago/index.html,"He was there for roughly four hours.Bloomberg first reported that he had appeared.Prosecutors asked Corcoran about what had occurred up until the August 8, 2022, search of Mar-a-Lago, which came after investigators found evidence that made them believe classified records kept at the Florida resort were moved and concealed -- including questions about his interactions with Trump, another person familiar with the situation said.The disclosure of Corcoran's testimony comes amid a steady drip of recent moves by special counsel Jack Smith to obtain grand jury testimony from very close contacts of Trump, in many cases about what Trump was told and what he said at the end of his presidency and afterward.It also comes amid an escalation of activity in Smith's other Trump probe, looking into January 6, 2021, and efforts to impede the transfer of power following the 2020 election. Smith issued a subpoena in that investigation to former Vice President Mike Pence in recent days, seeking documents and testimony. Trump's former national security adviser Robert O'Brien also received a subpoena, as CNN first reported.Corcoran declined to answer some questions in the grand jury that would have divulged his advice to Trump and their conversations, citing attorney-client privilege, the person familiar added. The Justice Department has repeatedly tried in the investigation to force witnesses to answer questions they declined to respond to in the grand jury, but the courts will ultimately have to decide if Corcoran must say more.As one of Trump's primary criminal defense lawyers since he left the presidency, Corcoran has been in touch with federal investigators and the National Archives for much of the course of the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation.He had drafted a letter signed by another attorney last June that said Trump's team had done a diligent search and turned over classified records in their possession. Even still, the DOJ believed its investigation was being obstructed, prompting investigators to obtain a search warrant from a court in August. Hundreds more records with classified markings were found, with additional being turned over by Trump's lawyers to the DOJ in the past few months.This story has been updated with additional details."
193,Children orphaned by the quake in Turkey and Syria face an uncertain future,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/world/children-orphaned-earthquake-intl/index.html,"Reportedly named Aya -- meaning 'miracle' in Arabic -- she was born under the rubble of Monday's deadly earthquake, still attached to her mother's lifeless body by the umbilical cord when rescue workers found her.Her story certainly seems miraculous, as she survived for more than 10 hours under the wreckage of her family's five-story apartment building in northern Syria after it was leveled to the ground during the pre-dawn 7.8 magnitude quake.""We heard a voice while we were digging,"" the baby's cousin, Khalil al-Suwadi told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Tuesday. ""We cleared the dust and found the baby with the umbilical cord (intact), so we cut it and my cousin took her to hospital.""Tragically, the baby's mother did not survive and is thought to have died hours after giving birth. In fact, the newborn is believed to be the sole survivor of her immediate family, her cousin told the news agency.Orphan Aya -- who was reportedly named by medics -- is now receiving treatment at a children's hospital in the nearby town of Afrin, where pediatrician Hani Maarouf told AFP that she is stable but arrived with bruises, lacerations and hypothermia.Footage of her incredible rescue quickly went viral online and drew international attention. Many from around the world asked how they could adopt her. However, it has been confirmed that Aya's great-uncle, Salah al-Badran, will take her in once she is discharged from the hospital, despite his own home being destroyed in the earthquake, the Guardian reported.According to UNICEF emergency communication specialist Joe English, adoption should never occur in the immediate aftermath of an emergency. ""Until the whereabouts of a child's parent or other close family members can be verified, each separated child is considered to have living close relatives,"" he told CNN. ""Every effort should be made to reunify children with their families when suitable, if such reunification is in their best interest.""Similarly, 3-year-old Tariq Haidar was pulled alive from the wreckage of his home in Jandaris, northern Syria, 42 hours after the earthquake struck, Reuters news agency reported. He was taken to the hospital where doctors were forced to amputate his left leg.His family did not survive. Malek Qasida, a nurse caring for him, told Reuters: ""They pulled out his father and two of his siblings before him, dead."" The body of his mother and a third sibling were later recovered from the wreckage, locals said, according to Reuters.'Many, many children will have lost parents'Aya and Tariq are just two of the unknown number of children in Turkey and Syria who have been orphaned in the wake of Monday's deadly earthquake.The initial quake hit just after 4 a.m. local time, while many people were sleeping.""Whilst we don't yet have any verified numbers, given the catastrophic, and ever-increasing, death toll, it is clear that many, many children will have lost parents or caregivers in these devastating earthquakes,"" said English, from UNICEF.""Urgently identifying unaccompanied children and those who may have been separated from parents and caregivers is absolutely critical so that they can receive the appropriate care and support in the short term, and so that we can begin the work to locate and reunite them with family.""Following these kinds of disasters, displaced children, especially those who are unaccompanied or separated from family, are vulnerable to violence, exploitation, and abuse, including the risk of trafficking or gender-based violence.""He added: ""Beyond our immediate life-saving response providing safe drinking water, warm winter clothes, medical and nutritional supplies, UNICEF is also working with our partners to provide children affected with critical psychosocial and mental health support, to help them process their experiences and begin to address the trauma that many children may have experienced.""This is not a short-term job, and will require dedicated, long-term support, as we help children and families rebuild their shattered lives.""Meanwhile the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) -- made up of 15 leading UK aid charities -- said its member organizations would be closely monitoring and supporting unaccompanied and separated children.""They do this by establishing child-friendly spaces, providing age appropriate psychosocial and resilience activities, specialized case management and alternative care for unaccompanied and separated children,"" Madara Hettiarachchi, director of programs and accountability at the DEC, told CNN.Race against timeInformation regarding the exact number of children left without parents is still unclear. According to Turkey's Ministry of Family and Social Services on Friday, the families of 263 children who were pulled from the rubble in Turkey could not be reached.Among those children, 162 continue to receive care in hospital, while 101 children were transferred to the relevant units of the ministry and taken under institutional care after their treatment.The death toll in Turkey and Syria stands at more than 28,000, according to authorities.In Turkey, the number of people killed has risen to 24,617, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said at a news conference Saturday. In Syria, the total number of deaths stood at 3,575 as of Saturday.Rescue workers are racing against time to pull survivors from the rubble of collapsed buildings in freezing winter conditions.Efforts have also been hampered by blocked roads, damaged infrastructure and several violent aftershocks.There have been some incredible tales of survival. A 16-year-old boy was pulled alive from the rubble of a destroyed building in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, 119 hours after the devastating earthquake hit the country. A 10-year-old girl was brought out alive from under the wreckage in southern Turkey's Hatay province after 147 hours.However, CNN Romania affiliate Antena 3's reporter Cristian Popovici warned Friday that as the hours pass, incredible scenes such as these will become less frequent. ""The chances of this happening are less than 1%, especially because of below-freezing temperatures recorded here at night.""It is truly a miracle, unfortunately we see less and less of those now, but it is happening and that's what all these people here are working for, to continue saving lives.""The miraculous rescues seen over the past week have been scenes of incredible joy mixed with sadness, as some children are pulled alive from the rubble of their homes only to find that the rest of their immediate family did not survive. Aid agencies warn it's too early to say exactly how many children have been left orphaned in the tragedy."

195,'Exceptional' warming: January temperatures 2.2 degrees higher than average in Europe,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/europe/europe-extreme-heat-january-climate-intl/index.html,"The month started with a record-breaking heatwave, as New Year's Day saw an alarming number of heat records fall across the continent, with at least eight countries experiencing their warmest-ever January day. The climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe, told CNN at the time that it was ""the most extreme heat wave in European history.""The Balkans, eastern Europe, Finland, northwest Russia and Svalbard, the Arctic archipelago off the coast of Norway, all experienced particularly high temperatures in January, according to Copernicus, which analyzes billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.""While January 2023 is exceptional, these extreme temperatures remain a tangible indication of the effects of a changing climate for many regions and can be understood as an additional warning of future extreme events,"" Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement. Europe is warming faster than any other region, according to the World Meteorological Organization, as planet-heating pollution pushes temperatures towards critical warming thresholds.The continent is seeing increased wildfires, blistering heatwaves and destructive droughts.Globally, January temperatures were 0.25 degrees warmer than the 1991-2020 January average, according to the Copernicus data, with places including the eastern United States, Canada and Mexico experiencing above average temperatures.The data also found record levels of sea ice melt in Antarctica in January. Sea ice extent -- the amount of ocean covered in ice -- was 31% below average, the lowest levels the satellite dataset has ever recorded and significantly below the previous record set in 2017. Unlike the Arctic where sea ice has been melting for decades, Antarctica's sea ice is very variable. After years of sea ice increases, Antarctic sea ice started declining from 2016 and the region is now reporting record lows. Arctic sea ice extent was 4% below average, with the Barents Sea and Svalbard most affected, Copernicus data showed.It wasn't hot everywhere. Below average temperatures were recorded in countries including Siberia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Australia. Some scientists have pointed to Arctic warming as one reason behind the extreme cold snaps the world continues to experience, even as winters become warmer overall."
196,Knox Pride Festival threatens to cancel if bill that could outlaw drag in public places becomes law,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/us/knox-pride-festival-outlaw-drag-law/index.html,"Organizers of Knox Pride Festival say the law could make parts of its event against the law. Senate Bill 3 would make illegal any ""adult cabaret performances"" on public property or a place where the ""performance could be viewed by a person who is not an adult.""In the proposed law ""adult cabaret performances"" are performances featuring ""topless dancers, go-go dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest, or similar entertainers, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration,"" according to the proposed law.   The bill has been approved by the Tennessee House and is awaiting approval from the Republican-controlled Senate. If approved by the legislative body, the office of Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, said he plans to sign the bill.""The Governor expects to sign the legislation, but as always, he will review the final legislation when it reaches his desk,"" Lee spokeswoman Jade Byers told CNN. The bill's sponsor says the measure is an effort to protect children in the state.""This legislation is about protecting children,"" Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Republican, said in a news release last week, after the bill cleared subcommittees in the house.Last November when the legislation was introduced, Senator Johnson said the bill was ""aimed at protecting children from sexualized drag queen events.""A spokesperson for the senator said the bill has been misinterpreted.""The bill does not ban drag shows in public. Under the bill, only performances that are overtly sexual would be age restricted. There has been a lot of inaccurate information claiming that the bill would ban drag shows or ban drag shows in public. The bill is specifically targeted at restricting sexually explicit performances,"" Molly Gormley, press secretary for The Tennessee Senate Republican Caucus told CNN in an email.""If the bill passes, Knox Pride has no reason to cancel their parade or festivities, unless they plan on their entire event being made up of overtly sexual drag performances,"" Gormley told CNN.But organizers disagree.""If this moves forward into law, the Knox Pride Festival, and potentially the Parade, would be against the law in the ways we have presented entertainment in support of the LGBTQIA+ community. You can no longer say you're an ally if you are not helping us fight this,"" John Camp the executive director of Knox Pride said in a news release.If the bill becomes law, first offense violators would face a little less than a year in jail and/or a fine up to $2,500. Second offenses would be felonies and carry up to six years in prison and fines up to $3,000.Knox Pride is a popular free pride event, according to the organizers. The annual event draws an estimated 75,000 to 80,000 people. This year's festival is scheduled for October 6. The festival organizers say it is the largest fundraiser for a resource center operated by Knox Pride which supports the community with a food pantry, a clothing store, and support groups for the community.CNN's parent company, Warner Bros.

198,Biden says he's not ready to make 2024 decision,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/2024-joe-biden-reelection/index.html,"""I'm just not ready to make it,"" Biden told Telemundo when asked in an interview what was stopping him from deciding on another run.Biden said the day after the November midterms that he ""intended"" to run again, barring any unforeseen episode. And he and his family have signaled to others -- including in early December to the visiting French President Emmanuel Macron -- that they are preparing for a run.Biden's reluctance to definitively announce his intentions is in part driven by a desire to avoid triggering compliance with candidate election laws. Advisers, however, note that when Biden says he's a ""great respecter of fate,"" it's less of a dodge than it would appear.It's largely expected that the president will formally announce a reelection run some time in the weeks and months after Tuesday's State of the Union, which was seen as a preview of what his message would be as he asks voters for a second term.Biden said there was ""no"" motive behind him stopping short of an announcement. And he said surveys showing many Democrats eager for another candidate were flawed.""That's not what I hear,"" he said. ""Look, do you know any polling that's accurate these days? You all told me that there was no way we were going to do well in this off-year election. I told you from the beginning we're going to do well. Y'all told me I couldn't win the general election. We did well. I feel good about where we are.""An ABC/Washington Post poll released this weekend showed 58% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they would prefer a candidate other than Biden next year.Biden said he felt good about the position within his party.""I feel good about the way things are, and I feel good about the reception I get,"" he said. ""And I think it's awfully difficult to poll these days.""Still, he acknowledged the outcome of the 2024 race was unknowable.""It may be that, you know, I run, I get clobbered, and if I run, I win. I mean, that's not my motive. That's not the basis upon which I make the judgment,"" he said.Speaking after an event in Florida, Biden said he didn't view a difference between the state's two likely Republican presidential contenders, former President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis.""I think that they have a similar modus operandi, a similar way in which they work. But I really don't know. I've never decided to run or not run based on who the opponent will be,"" he said."
199,Democracy on the agenda as Biden meets Brazil's Lula at the White House,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/joe-biden-meets-lula/index.html,"The talks, expected to center around efforts to combat climate change and tackle anti-democratic extremism, came roughly a month after protesters aligned with far-right former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed government institutions in Brasilia following Bolsonaro's election loss.""Both of our nations' strong democracies have been tested of late, very much tested, and our institutions put in jeopardy,"" Biden told Lula in the Oval Office on Friday. ""But in both the United States and Brazil, democracy prevailed.""The event carried troubling echoes of the US insurrection attempt on January 6, 2021, not least because Bolsonaro was closely aligned with former US President Donald Trump. After his election loss, Bolsonaro decamped for the United States; he has been living near Orlando, Florida, for more than a month.""To defend democracy is an obligation of all democrats in the world,"" Lula told CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour in an interview in Washington. ""I (could never) have imagined that it could happen in US, in North America, the invasion of the Capitol. As I never could imagine that in Brazil, after a democratic procession with elections, we could have an invasion of the Congress, the supreme court and the presidential palace.""""This means that you have an extreme right running around the world, an extreme right that is very nervous and that uses fake news as if it was a tool to develop politics and to talk to people, to communicate with people,"" he went on. ""And we have to destroy, you know, this narrative that they use against the democrats.""For Biden, the episode was another sign that protecting democracy is a global imperative.By extending an early invitation to Lula to visit the White House, Biden hoped to cultivate closer ties and demonstrate his support for one of the Western Hemisphere's key players.Biden quickly called Lula following his victory late last year, hoping to demonstrate support after Bolsonaro had laid the groundwork to question the election results. The move was received well among Lula's officials, who saw it as a sign Biden was looking to restore US-Brazil ties.Biden largely iced Bolsonaro out, engaging with him only sparingly. With the left-wing Lula, he finds more of an ideological ally.They have met previously; when Biden was vice president, he met Lula on the sidelines of a gathering in Chile. But as counterparts, they will look to deepen what has traditionally been a key bilateral relationship in the Western Hemisphere, strained in recent years by the diametrically opposed Biden and Bolsonaro.Rebuilding those bonds, and affirming a commitment to democracy, was key in their first face-to-face meeting.""I affirm the United States' unwavering support for Brazil's democracy, and respect for the free will of the Brazilian people,"" Biden said Friday. ""We reject political violence.""Hanging over the meeting was Bolsonaro's continued presence in the United States. Bolsonaro is seeking a six-month tourist visa to remain in the US, the law firm representing Bolsonaro confirmed to CNN Brasil on January 30. The US State Department has refused to confirm Bolsonaro's visa status due to confidentiality.Bolsonaro has been in Florida since December 30, leaving Brazil days before the January 1 inauguration of his successor. His presence in Florida has drawn criticism by House Democrats, who in mid-January urged Biden not to ""provide shelter"" for Bolsonaro in the wake of his supporters storming Brazil's democratic institutions in the capital Brasília.Lula told Amanpour there was ""no chance for (Bolsonaro) to come back to the presidency of the republic.""Ahead of Friday's visit, a US official said Biden was prepared to discuss ""any issue"" that Lula wanted, but suggested they did not expect Bolsonaro's status in the United States to arise. The official said they were unaware of any formal extradition requests related to Bolsonaro.""If and when we receive one, I know we will give it the deserving response,"" the official said.Instead, officials described an agenda focused mainly on areas of agreement, though on Ukraine there could be some dissension.Atop the agenda was climate change, which has already been the primary focus of their two phone calls. When he was in office, Bolsonaro sped up deforestation of the Amazon. Lula has vowed to protect the forest and advance efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.They were also expected to discuss ways to bolster democracy and efforts inside both countries to advance human rights, social inclusion, gender equality and safeguarding LGBTQ rights, a senior US administration official said.Other topics on the agenda included economic matters and an early conversation about Brazil's 2024 presidency of the G20.An area they may not be as closely aligned is on Ukraine. Lula has adopted a policy of non-intervention, rebuffing efforts led by Biden to united the global community in opposition to Russia's invasion.Lula was expected to propose a ""peace club"" meant to negotiate an end to the war, including countries like China and India that haven't taken as firm a stance in opposition to the invasion.Biden is ""looking forward"" to hearing out Lula's proposals for Ukraine, the senior administration official said, and the US will ""respect and support efforts by Lula to promote dialogue and peace."" Biden welcomes Lula's readiness to to reengage on the global stage, the official said.Still, the official acknowledged Biden and Lula ""may not always agree on everything"" but have a shared interest in ensuring peace."
200,Biden has yet to say just how he would strengthen Social Security and Medicare trust funds,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/biden-social-security-medicare-trust-funds/index.html,"He is vowing to shore up the shaky finances of Medicare's trust fund, extending its solvency to the middle of the century instead of the expected depletion date of 2028. ""I will not cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit. In fact, I'm going to extend the Medicare trust fund for at least two decades,"" Biden said Thursday in a speech in Florida, echoing similar comments from his State of the Union address earlier in the week.But just how he will accomplish this objective -- as well as one to strengthen Social Security -- remains to be seen. Other than repeating his common refrain of making the wealthy and big corporations pay more, he has yet to outline a vision for securing the entitlement programs. It's a goal that has eluded many presidents and lawmakers before him, and the divided Congress will make it that much more difficult to accomplish.Asked for more information, the White House said, ""We will provide more details on March 9, when the president releases his budget, backed up by full, transparent accounting.""Pressed about his plan, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday that she's ""just not going to get ahead of what the president is going to lay out on his budget.""Biden is touting many of the financial benefits for Medicare enrollees in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress passed last summer. The law aims to reduce seniors' drug costs and is expected to produce savings for the federal government. But it will not help Medicare's troubled hospital insurance trust fund, known as Medicare Part A, which pays for services such as inpatient hospital care.The trust fund will only be able to pay scheduled benefits until 2028, according to the most recent Medicare trustees report. At that time, the fund's reserves will be depleted, and Medicare's revenues will only be able to cover 90% of total benefits.Longtime Medicare and Social Security advocates are very interested in learning more about Biden's strategy to protect the entitlement programs, particularly how he would extend Medicare's solvency for at least two decades.""I haven't seen a plan that does that,"" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs. ""Our members will be eager to see what the approach is there.""Tall order on MedicareA president's budget is an aspirational accounting of the policy priorities he wants lawmakers to take up. Congress is not required to follow its provisions, and often doesn't, though lawmakers may look to it as a guide.Based on his State of the Union address, Biden will presumably include tax measures in the budget that will add new revenue to the Medicare trust fund, said Matt Kazan, a managing director at Avalere Health, a consulting firm.It could involve changes to the Medicare payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, split between workers and their employers. Or it may entail other new tax policies that would funnel money to the trust fund, Kazan said, pointing to two levies passed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.Another unknown is whether Biden also plans to include non-tax provisions aimed at improving Medicare's fiscal health in his budget.""Extending solvency by more than two decades would likely require substantial changes in policy or a series of small, but still serious, changes,"" said Kazan, who spent more than a decade as a senior health policy adviser for Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee.Addressing Social Security's trust fund woesSocial Security is also in bad fiscal shape. The combined Social Security trust funds -- which help support payouts for the elderly, survivors and Americans with disabilities -- are projected to deplete their reserves in 2035, according to the most recent Social Security trustees report. At that time, the program's income will only be enough to cover 80% of scheduled benefits.This year, workers will pay 6.2% on the first $160,200 of their wage and salary income into Social Security. Their employers match that amount. A wide range of proposals have been floated over the years to shore up Social Security's finances. Some focus on raising more revenue by changing the payroll tax that supports the entitlement, while others look to limit benefits in various ways, including raising the full retirement age or curbing payments for higher-income earners or future retirees.""Everyone says I'm for that, I'm for Social Security,"" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, who opposes any benefit cuts. ""But it's when you get into some of the details that it gets complicated.""Some lawmakers have floated the idea of levying the payroll tax on higher income earners. For instance, Democratic Rep. John Larson of Connecticut would impose it on earnings above $400,000 -- which would be in keeping with Biden's pledge not to raise taxes on those below that threshold. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden said that he would put Social Security ""on a path to long-term solvency by asking Americans with especially high wages to pay the same taxes on those earnings that middle-class families pay."" In addition, he proposed a variety of benefit enhancements, including higher payments for very old retirees, surviving spouses and low-income workers.Nancy Altman, president of advocacy group Social Security Works, is waiting to see a more specific plan from Biden.""The administration has not laid out something that can be converted into legislation and introduced in Congress,"" Altman said. ""So that's what I'm hoping he will do."""

Police issued a warrant for Leiner Miranda Lopez, 26, who has not been apprehended, the office said.   Both men, who are from Jersey City, New Jersey, have been charged with one count of desecrating/concealing human remains in connection with the death of 33-year-old Luz Hernandez, whose body was found on Tuesday, a day after she was reported missing to police, the prosecutor's office said in a news release Wednesday.Officers had conducted a welfare check on Hernandez on Monday after she was reported missing. ""The findings resulted in the Jersey City Police Department contacting the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office for assistance,"" the release said.""During the course of the investigation, the Homicide Unit located what appeared to be a shallow grave in the area of Central Avenue and Third Street in Kearny,"" according to the release. ""The body of a female was recovered a short time later and she was pronounced dead at the scene at 4:53 p.m."" Hernandez died of blunt force trauma to the head and compressions to the neck, and her manner of death was ruled a homicide, according to prosecutors.Santana and Lopez were stopped by police on Sunday on Central Avenue in Kearny before Hernandez was reported missing, prosecutors said.Their vehicle was unregistered and the Kearny Police Department impounded it, according to the prosecutor's office. A court-authorized search of the vehicle on Tuesday resulted in the discovery of evidence in the case.Prosecutors didn't say who reported Hernandez missing to the police in Jersey City.Hernandez was a popular kindergarten teacher at the BelovED Community Charter School in Jersey City, Bret Schundler, the school's founder, told CNN Thursday. She started as a teacher's assistant in 2017 and had worked her way up to become lead kindergarten teacher, he said.Hernandez was a ""beloved member of the BelovED community"" who was loved by students and staff alike, Schundler said.   ""Everyone is devastated,"" Schundler said. ""She was a wonderful person, and very much an important part of the community."" The school closed on Wednesday and reopened on Thursday with additional counselors on site, Schundler said.  CNN is seeking comment from the Jersey City Police Department as well as the Kearny Police Department, which is assisting with the investigation.  "
202,Florida lawmakers vote to give GOP-appointed state prosecutor jurisdiction over election and voting matters,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/election-crimes-florida-lawmakers-desantis/index.html,"The bill, which passed the state House of Representatives on Friday on a 77-33 vote, is a top priority for the Republican governor, who last year approved the creation of a controversial new Office of Elections Crimes and Security as part of a sweeping voting overhaul. The state Senate already passed the new bill on Wednesday, 27-12, along party lines. Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers. The measure comes after DeSantis initiated a crackdown on voter fraud that resulted in the arrest of 20 individuals accused of voting illegally in 2020. However, the move hit a legal snag in some cases, including in Miami-Dade County, where a judge dismissed a case against a Miami defendant on the grounds that the state prosecutor had acted beyond its authority.The bill clarifies that the state prosecutor, a position under the Florida attorney general, has jurisdiction on election and voting matters. The move would allow the DeSantis administration to steer prosecution of cases identified by the Office of Elections Crimes and Security to a prosecutor appointed by Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, and not leave it up to local elected district attorneys, who could be Democrats.  A coalition of civil and voting rights groups, including the NAACP Florida, ACLU of Florida, Common Cause Florida, All Voting is Local Action, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, League of Women Voters of Florida, Legal Defense Fund, and Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, responded to the legislation's passage by calling it ""a solution in search of a problem.""""This bill is being heard and swiftly passed only because the Governor desires to expand his prosecutorial authority over Floridians who are lawfully trying to exercise their right to vote. The office made arrests, claimed jurisdiction, and is now seeking to change the law after the courts said no. We have grave concerns about the potential for this office targeting returning citizens for honest mistakes about their eligibility to vote in an effort to intimidate communities of color,"" the coalition said in a statement Friday. In debate before Friday's vote, state Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat, said she was ""incredibly concerned that because there are some in the Republican base who think elections were stolen that we're feeding that narrative.""GOP state Rep. Juan Fernandez-Barquin, however, said the legislation ""further protects the integrity of our most sacred right: the right to vote. ""This insures fraud will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, the way it should,"" the Miami lawmaker said.This story has been updated with additional reaction. "

204,"Exclusive: US developed method to track China's spy balloon fleet within last year, sources say",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/us-balloon-tracking-method/index.html,"After President Joe Biden took office in 2021, a Chinese spy balloon briefly transited the continental United States, as administration officials have acknowledged. Afterwards, the intelligence community ran some of the balloon's signals through the US' intelligence holdings and other data to see where and when they may have popped up in the past. The findings have allowed the US to develop a consistent technical method for the first time that they have used to track the balloons in near-real time across the globe, the sources said. The existence of this method could further inflame criticism from Republican lawmakers that the administration didn't act quickly enough to prevent the balloon from entering US airspace last week.Officials were also able to use the information collected from the earlier balloon alongside other sources to discover that similar surveillance balloons had transited US territory undetected at least three times under the Trump administration. Officials declined to say how the signals were collected, and it is not clear how long it took the intelligence community to develop the new method, which was first used in 2022. But the new method is important because the balloons are extremely difficult to track without it -- they are slow-moving and can fly extremely high, in some cases as high as much as 60 miles up, and can evade the more traditional radars that are oriented toward detecting fast-moving missiles and counterterrorism threats, a lawmaker familiar with the intelligence told CNN.Officials emphasized that the balloon's signals were an important key to discovering a tracking method, but not the only piece of the puzzle. One Defense Department official described the process by which the US was able to identify past instances of these so-called high-altitude balloons -- what the Pentagon now refers to as HABs -- as ""piecing together'' different clues from different sources of intelligence.""We were able to go back and look at the historical patterns"" of the balloons,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said this week. ""And that led us to come to understand that during the Trump administration, there were multiple instances where the surveillance balloons traversed American airspace and American territory.""The revelation that the intelligence community only within the last year developed a reliable way to track China's balloon fleet -- which officials now say has flown dozens of missions worldwide -- helps explain why Trump administration officials have stridently claimed to have had no knowledge of the three alleged flights over US territory during the former president's time in office.Senior Trump administration officials including former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, as well as ex- national security adviser John Bolton have all said they were not notified that Chinese balloons entered US airspace under the last administration.A broader understanding of the Chinese fleetThe tracking method provided an important tool as US officials monitored the latest balloon to transit the continental United States, gathering intelligence on it as it crossed the country before it was ultimately shot down off the coast of South Carolina last Saturday.""This last week provided the United States with a unique opportunity to learn a lot more about the Chinese surveillance balloon program, all information that will help us to continue to track these kinds of objects,"" Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Wednesday. And it has allowed the US to keep an eye on other Chinese spy balloons around the globe. Another balloon, in South America, recently went down in the ocean to the east of the continent -- although at this point, US officials tell CNN, they aren't entirely sure what happened. Three US officials familiar with the intelligence say that the US still isn't certain whether some of these balloons are equipped with a self-destruct mechanism. The US' ability to track the balloons' whereabouts has also added to the broader understanding of how large China's balloon surveillance program actually is. On Thursday, officials revealed that they believe the spy balloons the US has discovered are part of a large fleet that is conducting surveillance operations globally on behalf of China's military, the People's Liberation Army. So far, the US has traced the balloons to 40 countries across five continents, officials said. A 2022 military intelligence report obtained by CNN said a balloon was tracked near Guam as far back as 2019.A former government official investigating strange aerial sightings by Navy pilots over recent years  -- some of which government officials have said have turned out to be balloons -- described a meeting several months ago where a defense official ""pulled out of his pocket a piece of a Chinese balloon with Chinese writing on it.""""The point is, it's not new that there are Chinese balloons,"" the former official told CNN.The US was able to track the latest balloon's path even before it entered US airspace. The Defense Intelligence Agency warned that the balloon was headed for the US on January 27, one day before it entered the country over Alaska, officials told CNN. But military and intelligence officials believed the best course of action would be to continue tracking the balloon and collect intelligence on it, as it was not deemed a threat as it crossed over the US and shooting it down would risk civilian lives and reduce the chances of recovering the balloon's equipment intact. US officials briefed members of Congress on Thursday that the balloon had the ability to collect so-called ""signals intelligence"" and transmit data to the mainland of China -- but that it appeared to stop transmitting once the US learned about it, limiting how much intelligence it was able to gather on behalf of Beijing, according to sources familiar with the briefing.The US also understands that China is using the balloons for surveillance based on ""high-resolution imagery"" taken by reconnaissance planes as they flew past the balloon that flew over the US last week.""We know the PRC used these balloons for surveillance,"" an official said. ""High-resolution imagery from U-2 flybys revealed that the high-altitude balloon was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.""  "

""As a team, we've decided to take job action,"" Sinclair told TSN, ""and from this moment on will not be participating in any Canadian Soccer Association activities until this is resolved. ""It hurts, I'm not going to lie,"" she added. ""But it's gotten to a point where, at least for me personally, until this is resolved I can't represent this federation. I'm such a competitor that breaks my heart and kills me..."" Canada Soccer said in a statement that pay equity ""is at the core of our ongoing player negotiations,"" and that it has ""already issued a mutually-agreed to retroactive payment.""It added that it had ""presented an equity-based proposal to our national teams and their counsel several months ago, and we are still waiting for a definitive response to the terms of that proposal."" The players said that they had been negotiating with Canada Soccer for more than a year and are now ""being told to prepare to perform at a world-class level without the same level of support that was received by the Men's National Team in 2022."" Training camps have been cut for the women's team, as well as the number of players and staff invited and the already limited youth program, the players' statement said. ""We expect and deserve nothing less than to be treated equally and fairly and to have our program - and our World Cup preparations - funded appropriately,"" it added. CNN has reached out to Canada Soccer and Sport Canada for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication. Canada, the reigning women's soccer Olympic champion, is scheduled to face the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) on February 16th in its first match of the SheBelieves Cup. Several players inside and outside of Canada expressed their own frustration with Canada Soccer. USWNT striker Alex Morgan asked: ""What do they have to do, win a gold medal? Sell out stadiums?"" while Canadian winger Adriana Leon tweeted: ""At a loss for words for how Canada Soccer continues to conduct themselves and how they continue to get away with it... With the current governance, I worry for future generations...Where is the money going???"" Players from the Men's National Team also released their own statement via midfielder Mark-Anthony Kaye, ""wholeheartedly"" supporting the Women's National Team.  They too went on strike in June last year ahead of a friendly with Panama due to a dispute over player compensation.  Both teams called on Sport Canada, a branch of the country's federal government, in July to investigate Canada Soccer following serious allegations about the way decisions are made within the organization.  They were prompted by a TSN report which, citing four unnamed sources, found that Canada Soccer was unable to adequately compensate players due to a contract it signed with a private company Canada Soccer Business (CSB), which keeps a large share of the revenue generated by national teams. At the time, Canada Soccer told CNN that the negotiations with its national teams ""have no bearing on the CSB agreement voted on and passed by our Board."" The Canadian Premier League, which launched Canadian Soccer Business in 2018, did not respond to CNN's request for comment at the time.The Men's National Team statement released on Friday added that ""Canada Soccer has consistently refused or blatantly ignored our Players Association's requests for access to its financial records,"" and demanded that the organization ""explain what has happened to millions of dollars that it should be receiving each year from sponsors and other sources."" Both statements released by the men's and women's teams called for new leadership at Canada Soccer if it is ""not willing"" or able to support the players. "
207,Washington Post: Trump campaign commissioned research that failed to prove 2020 election fraud claims,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/politics/trump-2020-election-fraud-researchers-wapo/index.html,"The Berkeley Research Group was commissioned to look into voting data from six states, according to the Post, and a source told the publication that the campaign team wanted about a dozen claims tested. People familiar with the matter told the publication that the findings did not match what the team had hoped for, and the findings were never released.While some anomalies and ""unusual data patterns"" were found, the Post reported, they wouldn't have made a difference to President Joe Biden's victory. The firm's findings also refuted some of Trump's voting conspiracies, including the identities of dead people used to vote and Dominion voting systems used to manipulate the outcome, the paper reported.The research was conducted in the last weeks of 2020 and before the January 6 US Capitol attack, according to the Post. Two sources told CNN that the House January 6 committee looking into the role Trump played in inciting the insurrection did not know about the firm's work. Trump has continued to repeat his election lies as he focuses on his 2024 White House bid. CNN previously reported that following two years of advice from allies and advisers to stop exhaustively relitigating the 2020 election, his first rally late last month showed an attempted forward-driven message of what he would aim to accomplish with a second term.The former president has often pushed back on that advice, arguing that his message is strong enough as it is, and one source close to him told CNN his proclivity for focusing on the 2020 election will be tough to break because he still regularly hears from members of his base who believe so-called election integrity is an important talking point as he seeks reelection. Another adviser said that despite the defeat of several Trump-backed midterm candidates who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, Trump has said he does not believe their losses were tied to their election lies."
208,Bill Ackman announces foundation funding for controversial ousted MIT and Whitehead Institute scientist,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/us/ackman-sabatini-mit-whitehead-institute-sexual-misconduct/index.html,"Dr. David Sabatini, best known for scientific discoveries in cell biology related to mTOR, a protein that helps regulate cell functions, resigned from the Whitehead Institute in August 2021 after an independent investigation found that he violated Whitehead's anti-harassment policies. Sabatini ran a lab at the Whitehead Institute for more than two decades, and the report faulted him in part for the lab culture he created, and for engaging in a sexual relationship with a Whitehead fellow he mentored.When he was pushed out of Whitehead, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute rejected his resignation opting to terminate his employment as a principal investigator, and MIT, where he'd been a tenured professor, put him on an unpaid leave of absence.Sabatini, who has denied claims against him and maintained the sexual relationship with his mentee was consensual and is suing her for defamation, will again have the opportunity to run a research lab through a $25 million grant funded by Ackman's Pershing Square Foundation and an anonymous donor. ""I'd never had an issue from HR, right , HR never came and said 'there's a complaint against you,'"" Sabatini told CNN about the time prior to the Whitehead investigation. ""One thing that I wanted to be was always better and I mean, the irony of the situation is I actually think I was not only doing my best science, but I also think I was being the best mentor I had been when all this happened.""The funding announcement unfolded publicly on the heels of a Boston Globe Spotlight two-part report detailing a monthslong investigation into the allegations against Sabatini published in late January.Ackman said in a tweet that his foundation was looking to secure funding partners to support a new Sabatini lab, linking to the Spotlight team's story that Ackman called an accurate and balanced portrayal of the facts.Two days later, the activist investor publicly announced he'd secured funding from a donor but declined to say who.A representative for Ackman declined to comment further on how the funding came about or reveal the anonymous donor.Ackman has publicly maintained his support for Sabatini through the scandal and political backlash since the scientist's ouster in 2021. Sabatini has been a member of the scientific advisory council for Ackman's Pershing Square Sohn Cancer Research Alliance since 2019, a board that reviews research proposals for grant awards.It's the only board he wasn't removed from amid the controversy, according to Sabatini who was stripped of millions of dollars in research grants and esteemed positions when the Whitehead allegations became public. The funding decision for the new lab was primarily made by Ackman and his wife, Neri Oxman, with the Pershing Square Foundation trustees separate from the scientific advisory board, Ackman also said on Twitter.The logistics for the future lab and research plans aren't ironed out, Sabatini told CNN, but the scientist hopes to continue his work in basic science exploratory research and would do so in Boston if he has his druthers.Canceled by Academia Whether a university will be willing to host a Sabatini lab remains to be seen. Several researchers in the field said it poses a challenge but not an impossibility to start a lab without the built-in resources of an established research institution. Sabatini resigned from MIT thinking he'd lined up another faculty position at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine only for that to fall through in the spring of 2022, he said. MIT President Rafael Reif released a statement at the time of his resignation saying that an MIT review concluded that Sabatini violated MIT's Consensual Sexual or Romantic Relationships in the Workplace or Academic Environment policy and his tenure should be revoked.""Specifically, the reviewers found Professor Sabatini engaged in a sexual relationship with a person over whom he held a career-influencing role, he did not disclose the relationship at any time to his supervisors, and he failed to take any steps to relinquish his mentoring and career-influencing roles, as the policy requires. The Committee also had significant concerns regarding his unprofessional behavior toward some lab members,"" Reif said in the statement. Sabatini opted not to request an appeal process that would initiate a faculty committee review of the recommendation to revoke tenure and report their findings and recommendation, Reif wrote.NYU Grossman School of Medicine administrators discretely vetted Sabatini for a position in the spring of 2022 but ultimately didn't hire him amid loud pushback.Soon after the faculty position leaked in an industry publication, NYU students and faculty staged a walkout protest and hundreds signed an open letter imploring the administration not to bring Sabatini to campus. The medical school then released a statement that it had been determined that ""it will not be possible"" for Sabatini to join the faculty.The debate over the allegations and the institutions' handling of the situation has played out publicly among the niche science community on Twitter.A group of Sabatini's former lab members wrote an anonymous letter in support of their mentor hoping it might help persuade NYU to take him on.The group of 45 alumni whose time in Sabatini's lab spanned the lab's 24 years expressed their dismay and surprise at the allegations against Sabatini. ""We cherished our time in this unique environment, and this is evidenced by the fact that our colleagues from our times in David's lab have become our professional and personal family in many ways. With this letter, we wish to affirm that we never experienced or observed an abusive lab culture or a sexualized lab environment, and we did not witness sexual harassment,"" the anonymous letter said. The allegationsSoon after her arrival at Whitehead in 2020, the newly appointed Director Dr. Ruth Lehmann commissioned an institute-wide Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Assessment.The anonymous survey yielded responses from male and female scientists alleging workplace misconduct by Sabatini and some of his lab members. The findings were presented in March 2021 and Sabatini was confronted with the pointed allegations and the reality that the next step would be an independent investigation into him and his lab. A focus on improving workplace environments and weeding out sexual harassment was happening at institutions around the country at this point after a mandate from a major government grant source, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to ""develop and implement policies and practices that foster a harassment-free environment"" or risk losing funding. Lehmann contracted an independent law firm that ultimately produced a 248-page report after a five-month investigation in which investigators said they substantiated claims made against Sabatini in the anonymous DEI survey. The confidential report was never officially released in full, but pieces have surfaced since Sabatini exited. Whitehead continues to fight to keep it sealed in active litigation with Sabatini, though an annotated version was leaked by an anonymous supporter of his on Twitter.""Sabatini created a lab culture in which fear of retaliation by Sabatini was pervasive and reinforced by Sabatini's explicit threats to withdraw support of lab members whom he suspected had reported or discussed him or his lab outside the lab,"" the report's executive summary stated according to a court filing. ""Sabatini violated Whitehead's Anti-Harassment Policies by, notwithstanding his denials, engaging in inappropriate, sexist and sexualized discussions with lab members, which had the effect of creating a lab environment where sexual banter was rewarded.""A former male lab member that helped organize the supportive alumni letter said the assertion that Sabatini's lab had a sexually charged culture was a mischaracterization.  ""A mischaracterization of an informal workplace that is populated by people with MDs and PhDs who are in their 20s and 30s who are, you know, underpaid and together long hours and it's just not a viper pit of sexual harassment the way that the Whitehead statement made it sound,"" he said. The lab member did acknowledge that the dynamic of spending free time socializing with colleagues often involving alcohol common in rigorous research environments can create an environment where the lines of professionalism blur. ""I think it does create a gray area that academia is understandably grappling with right now,"" he said. ""Because you're working on something you're very dedicated to and a lot of your social time ends up being your work time.""The report also concluded, ""Sabatini's commendation of and affinity for outspoken scientists and his pressure to put science above all else creates two unique structural barriers in his lab that disproportionately disadvantages female lab members.""In interviews with CNN, several former female lab members expressed that their personal experiences in Sabatini's lab were positive and career-boosting. They never felt uncomfortable in the lab, they said.Nada Kalaany, an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School who worked in the Sabatini lab from 2005 to 2010, said she personally enjoyed her time there and never witnessed a sexualized lab dynamic.Kalaany, who was one of the only female postdoctoral fellows in the lab at the time, said she was especially struck by Sabatini's support during her pregnancies of her two children while working there. She also spoke of the friendships and career experiences she attributes to Sabatini's lab. ""He is laser-focused on the science like he breathes and he eats science. That's all he can think about. And it's so inspiring. I think I owe him a lot of what I have achieved so far. I learned a lot in his lab. So the excitement of discoveries and the fact that you can do it while having a nice atmosphere around you and being friendly and collegial.""The report determined that Sabatini and a Whitehead fellow, Dr. Kristin Knouse who reported complaints during the law firm's investigation, violated the Whitehead policy prohibiting consensual sexual relationships, though it did not make a finding as to whether the relationship was consensual -- a point still being litigated in pending lawsuits between the two.""Sabatini improperly leveraged his status as a preeminent senior scientist and senior member of Whitehead to garner favor, and to facilitate a secret sexual relationship with, [Dr. Knouse], his Fellow mentee. Sabatini's behavior toward [Dr. Knouse] and the relationship that followed, while unknown to lab members or to Whitehead prior to this investigation, violated Whitehead's Anti-Harassment Policy, its Consensual Sexual and Romantic Relationships Policy, and the spirit of its Employment of Family/Household Members Policy, as then in place,"" the report executive summary stated according to a court filing. The investigators said they also substantiated an anecdote first reported anonymously in the DEI survey that Sabatini asked a female lab member if she was having sex with another lab member and to rank male lab members in the order she'd have sex with them.  Sabatini told CNN he doesn't remember his exact phrasing in the conversation but maintained that the report mischaracterized the exchange he understood to be joking banter and denied ever asking the woman to rank anyone.Kathleen Ottina, Sabatini's former lab manager of over a decade said he would admonish lab members for crude language around her because she expressed her distaste for it, but Ottina also said she felt sexual banter ""wasn't discouraged"" generally in the lab.Ottina spoke highly of Sabatini's intellectual prowess and proven record of helping lab trainees build their careers, but still said she wouldn't want her own grandchildren to work in his lab.""I'd want them to be in an environment that pushed them that had high expectations that demanded really hard work from them. But I wouldn't want them to be exposed on a regular basis to a culture that was crude and vulgar,"" Ottina said.Sabatini pushed back on characterizations that sexism or a sexualized culture was perpetuated in his lab. ""Was my lab kind of freewheeling and fun? Yes, you know, was the word retarded used sometimes, yes. That there was sort of outright sexism to people, no, and I certainly wouldn't have tolerated that if that was the case so I do resist certainly a locker room atmosphere -- I resist that characterization. Was it light and banter-full and people joked around and made fun of each other sometimes, yes, but in a very mutual kind of way,"" Sabatini said of his lab.""The last year and a half for me have been beyond horrible, and I would not wish it on my worst enemy and just a simply beyond the horrible situation and as you can imagine I think also completely unfair and unfounded,"" Sabatini told CNN. Sabatini expressed some regret in a later email to CNN, acknowledging reports about him to an extent. ""I have learned from reading the HAS report and recent press articles, that there were a few lab trainees who were unhappy with my interactions with them. I deeply regret this and would welcome any opportunity to apologize to those impacted. I never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable and would never want anyone to feel less than 100% happy in my lab,"" Sabatini said in the email. ""If I am able to run another lab in the future, I will be extra vigilant to make sure that all lab members feel welcome and I will institute measures to uncover potential issues even if they are not brought to my attention. I would also be extra careful about the use of language that might, even if unintentionally, make someone feel less appreciated or uncomfortable in the lab.""A prohibited sexual relationship with a fellowSabatini filed a defamation lawsuit in October 2021 against the Whitehead Institute, its director and Dr. Knouse.Dr. Knouse filed a counterclaim against Sabatini for sexual harassment and retaliation months later. Knouse was a graduate student then Whitehead Fellow in 2018 and 2019 at the time of sexual relationship. Sabatini recommended her for the fellowship program and officially mentored at the Whitehead Institute,She's accused Sabatini of coercing her into a sexual relationship after grooming her for years as she pursued her MD/PhD in the Harvard-MIT program.Knouse's name was not released as part of the investigation when she filed her complaints at Whitehead and her identity was not made public in connection to the allegations before Sabatini filed the litigation against her. Sabatini maintains that the sexual relationship was consensual and in his lawsuit has argued Knouse wanted to punish his ex-lover and so fabricated complaints she brought to Whitehead Director Lehmann, spurring a coordinated effort to remove him from his position. Knouse and her attorney declined to comment on the record to CNN for this story. The litigation is ongoing. The independent report pointedly said it did not aim to determine whether the sexual relationship confirmed by Sabatini and Knouse was consensual. Regardless, the ban on workplace sexual relationships was a policy in place at MIT and Whitehead at the time and remains in effect. Retired MIT professor and longtime gender equity advocate Nancy Hopkins recalled the unwelcoming environment female scientists endured in academia throughout her career since the 1960s. ""And what we're seeing, I believe, is the evolution of these rules.""Hopkins, whose personal experiences have fueled her advocacy, said stricter policies are one way institutions have tried to tamp down systemic issues like gender inequality. ""How are you going make change if you don't follow the rules that were written to make change,"" Hopkins opined. "

210,House Intelligence chair says he prefers 'trigger-happy' approach with unidentified objects,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/12/politics/mike-turner-republican-unidentified-objects-cnntv/index.html,"A US fighter jet shot down an unidentified object over northern Canada on Saturday, marking the third time in a week that the US military has taken down objects in North American airspace. On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace by a US F-22, and a Chinese surveillance balloon was taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina last weekend.a.""I would prefer them to be trigger-happy than to be permissive, but we're going to have to see whether or not this is just the administration trying to change headlines,"" Turner, an Ohio Republican, said of the Biden administration in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""""What I think this shows, which is probably more important to our policy discussion here, is that we really have to declare that we're going to defend our airspace. And then we need to invest,"" added Turner. ""This shows some of the problems and gaps that we have. We need to fill those as soon as possible because we certainly now ascertain there is a threat.""There's no indication at this point that the unidentified objects have any connection to China's surveillance balloon but it seems that national security officials across the continent remain on edge. Airspace was briefly closed over Montana before being reopened on Saturday evening after a radar anomaly prompted a jet to investigate before the all-clear was given.Turner said Sunday that there is some frustration among lawmakers over the lack of timely briefings from the Biden administration. ""This is particularly annoying about this administration. The Biden administration needs to stop briefing Congress through our television sets and actually come and sit down and brief us,"" he said. ""I do think that there needs to be more engagement between the administration and Congress.""Senior Biden officials faced pointed questions last week on Capitol Hill from lawmakers in public hearings and classified briefings as Congress demands more information about why the suspected spy balloon wasn't shot down sooner. ""It's certainly a new, recent development that you have China being so aggressive in entering other countries' airspace and doing so for clear intentions to spy with very sophisticated equipment. I mean, the very scale of this balloon and the technology that was deployed by China in spying on the United States is unprecedented,"" Turner said Sunday. "

213,How one question from Joe Biden explains his feud with Rick Scott,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/biden-florida-rick-scott/index.html,"Riding the momentum of a strong State of the Union address and the elevation of a political battle he and his top advisers relish, he needed assurance on one detail for his scheduled remarks in Florida a few hours later. ""We have copies of the Scott plan at this event, right?"" Biden asked.Yes, he was told. The two-page, front-and-back pamphlets quoting Sen. Rick Scott's proposal to sunset all federal legislation, including Social Security and Medicare, every five years, would be there. By the time Biden arrived inside the University of Tampa ballroom where he was scheduled to speak, the White House-produced pamphlets had been placed on each chair in the audience.     It was a minor detail, particularly for a president, to focus on. Given those seats would be filled by partisans and Biden supporters, the pamphlets themselves would seem inconsequential in a broader political sense. The event itself would take place in a state few Democrats see as a true battleground in 2024 and would put Biden on the ground for less than four hours.But the placement of the pamphlets and Biden's message during his speech opened a window into the president's intense focus on the political salience of elevating one senator's proposal that long pre-dated Tuesday's primetime address.Biden's off-script back and forth with Republicans over Medicare and Social Security may have become a signature primetime moment, but it had roots in months of pressing advisers -- and other Democrats -- to make the issue central in the midterm elections and beyond. He would first bring it up in public for the first time fewer than three weeks after Scott released his ""12 Point Plan to Rescue America."" Biden was clear that it wasn't just a focus on Social Security and Medicare, two programs subject to a long-running fierce political and ideological debate between Republicans and Democrats.  He pressed advisers to print the actual words from Scott's proposal. At midterm campaign events, screens were put up that flashed the same, along with other quotes from Republicans. ""He zeroed in immediately on the idea that their own words were what would hang them here,"" a person familiar with the deliberations said.  'They just walked into it'When Biden boarded Air Force One for the flight to Florida, he walked straight back to where two Florida House Democrats were seated as invited guests back to their home state. Biden, eschewing his own cabin, sat down next to Reps. Kathy Castor and Darren Soto and buckled his seat belt. The group talked about a range of policy and political issues for the first half-hour of the flight. Castor had a packet to give Biden about an infrastructure project she was advocating for to secure a badly needed new air traffic control tower at Tampa Airport. (Before Biden left Air Force One, he came back to tell Castor that he'd spoken to his team, and they were on it.)But the conversation also covered the State of the Union address and ""how crazy it is"" to target Medicare, Castor said in an interview.After the flight, Castor would say BIden was ""on fire"" during the address, specifically referencing the Social Security and Medicare moment.""Because he has so much experience, because he has been in the trenches on Capitol Hill, I think he felt very comfortable hearing the heckling and being able to answer back,"" she said. As for her colleagues across the aisle? ""They just walked into it."" Biden has no intention of letting it go. He joked with the crowd in Tampa that they ""may have seen we had a little bit of a spirited debate in the State of the Union."" He ramped up his rhetorical defense of the programs. ""I know that a lot of Republicans, their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare,"" Biden told the crowd in Tampa. ""Well, let me say this: if that's your dream, I'm your nightmare.""For the second straight day he name-checked Republicans and their specific proposals or quotes about cutting, ending or restructuring the programs.For a second straight day he held up and referenced the pamphlet he wanted to ensure was in the room as he left the White House. For a second straight day he ramped up his attacks on Scott specifically.""The very idea a senator from Florida wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every five years, I find to be somewhat outrageous, so outrageous that you might not even believe it,"" Biden said. ""But that's what he said.""A perplexing destinationBiden's decision to make Florida one of his first post-State of the Union trips flummoxed some Democrats. Donald Trump won the state twice. When President Barack Obama won the state in 2008, with Biden by his side, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 700,000. Registered Republicans now outnumber Democrats by nearly 400,000. GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, who narrowly won his first statewide race, blew out his Democratic challenger in 2022 by 19 points, accelerating the running Democratic conversation about whether Florida has moved out of reach. Yet there it was in the first four states Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris planned to visit after the State of the Union. The other three -- Wisconsin, Georgia and Minnesota -- are battlegrounds critical to Biden's 2020 election win and to his path to reelection in 2024. Florida is, decidedly, not. What it is, aides note, is a state where one in five residents are over the age of 65 -- a prime venue to elevate a message focused on Social Security and Medicare.It's home to DeSantis, who has rocketed to the top tier of likely 2024 GOP presidential candidates with Biden advisers watching closely throughout with a view that he isn't nearly as strong of an opponent as his smashing reelection -- and the conservative buzz behind him -- has led the media to believe. But it's also home to Scott, a former governor himself who has carved out a role in the Senate as someone unafraid to cross Republican leadership or shy away from touching political third rails as he's pushed for dramatic change in Washington. True to form he hasn't backed down from a fight with Biden. He has fired back in interviews, on social media, and in a five-figure television ad buy set to run the same day Biden arrived in the state. He's called Biden a liar. He's pointed out that Biden sponsored his own sunset proposal in 1975. He's challenged him to a debate. He's called for him to resign. ""Nobody believes that I want to cut Medicare or Social Security. I've never said it,"" Scott said in an interview with CNN's Kaitlan Collins.But Democrats have taken to pointing out how other Republicans have reacted to Scott's plan -- ""sheer terror, sprint the other way, I don't know this man,"" was how one House Democrat described it -- as clear evidence that the attacks are both landing and are accurate.""Even Mitch McConnell says he can be a foil sometimes,"" Castor said with a laugh when asked if Democrats viewed Scott as a good political foil. There is no love lost between McConnell and Scott, with Scott's proposal and McConnell's vehement opposition to its emergence playing no small part in that reality.""It's clearly the Rick Scott plan, it is not the Republican plan,"" McConnell said in an interview with talk show host Terry Meiners from his home state of Kentucky. After calling Scott's proposal a ""bad idea,"" he added something that the long-time Senate GOP leader who assiduously protects members of his conference rarely, if ever, does. ""I think it will be a challenge for him to deal with this in his own reelection in Florida, a state with more elderly people than any other state in America,"" McConnell, who was challenged by Scott for leader at the start of this Congress, said in an implicit echo of Biden's rationale for traveling to the state this week. ""Some DC Republicans can keep parroting Democrat lies, but that won't stop Rick Scott from fighting for conservative principles instead of caving to Biden every day,"" Chris Hartline, Scott's senior adviser and longtime aide, said in a Twitter post on McConnell's remarks.White House officials watch and listen to all of it -- and are quick to respond to point out holes in Scott's comments or to level new attacks. The engagement isn't subtle, nor is it without intent. ""We want this fight,"" a White House official said. ""We relish this fight."" For Biden, the State of the Union didn't start that fight.He and his advisers had been keen to have it for nearly a year, despite private questions about the broader salience of a single Republican proposal, without broader GOP support and no pathway to becoming law, from some Democrats in the lead up to the midterm elections.The State of the Union thrust that fight -- and the running battle with a single senator -- to center stage, just weeks before Biden is expected to launch his final campaign. ""Who knows who's going to be the Republican nominee, but President Biden demonstrated today he's going to keep coming back to the Sunshine State,"" Castor said after Biden finished his remarks.After all, as Castor made a point of mentioning, Scott is up for reelection in Florida in 2024."

""The analysis concludes that the failure occurred due to a combination of factors, including bending stress on the pipe and a weld flaw at a pipe to fitting girth weld that was completed at a fabrication facility,"" TC Energy said in a news release Thursday. The operator explained that a weld flaw caused a crack in the pipe that continued to get worse over time because of stress and  fatigue from bending, eventually leading to the sudden rupture of the pipe. ""The cause of the bending stress remains under investigation as part of the broader third-party root cause failure analysis,"" TC Energy said.TC Energy noted that the investigation entailed the completion of an independent mechanical and metallurgical analysis of the failed pipe. The metallurgical analysis did not find issues with the strength or material properties of the pipe or manufactured fitting, the company added. ""The pipeline was operating within its operational design and within the pipeline design maximum operating pressure,"" TC Energy said. The spill, which leaked into a creek in Washington County, Kansas, cost about $480 million in clean-up efforts, TC Energy said. In the meantime, the operator said it's making progress on its remediation plan, including analysis of other areas and additional in-line inspections. The Keystone Pipeline, a 2,700-mile system that can transport more than 600,000 barrels of oil per day, delivers mostly Canadian oil to major refineries across America. The Keystone Pipeline has experienced leaks in the past, including one in South Dakota in 2016 and another one in 2019 in North Dakota that impacted nearly five acres."

The letter, dated January 30 and sent to former Superintendent Dr. George Parker, also claims that the daughter was ""subjected to numerous incidents of bullying, harassment, assault and battery"" during the school year. However, administrators ""did not take reasonable and appropriate actions to protect"" the student, despite being made aware of these issues.The family of another student alleges their child suffered injuries on the day of the shooting, according to a letter sent by the parents' attorney, Emily Mapp Brannon, to the city of Newport News. The January 30 letter does not include details on the injuries mentioned. At the time of the shooting, police said no one else was physically injured aside from the teacher.The school district would not comment in response to the letters. CNN reached out to both attorneys for the families but did not immediately hear back.The families' intent to potentially pursue legal action against the district is the latest blow to officials following intense criticism from frustrated parents over the way the situation was handled by administrators.After the shooting, the superintendent was ousted by a vote from the school board, the school's assistant principal resigned, the former principal was reassigned to another location, but the district did not say where. The school also implemented additional security measures including metal detectors and clear backpacks.Further, the letters were filed roughly a week after the teacher's attorney notified the Newport News School Board of intent to file a lawsuit over administrators' alleged failure to act when they were allegedly made aware of reports about a gun being on school premises. Teacher Abigail Zwerner was shot around 2 p.m. on January 6 inside a classroom, roughly 90 minutes after former assistant principal Dr. Ebony Parker was allegedly informed reports of the gun, according the legal notice filed by attorney Diane Toscano, the teacher's attorneyToscano's legal notice also detailed allegations of disturbing behavior displayed by the 6-year-old child prior to the shooting. Two days before the shooting, the student allegedly ""slammed"" and broke Zwerner's cell phone and cursed at guidance counselors, after which he was suspended, according to the document. After the one-day suspension, he returned to Zwerner's classroom and shot her.On the day of the shooting, another teacher overheard Zwerner say the 6-year-old student was in a ""violent mood,"" had threatened to beat up a kindergartner at the school and ""angrily stared down the security officer,"" according to the legal notice.After the shooting, the 6-year-old was placed under a temporary detention order and was evaluated at a local hospital.

""Sadly, that's where we are.""Kirby said Biden would send a message of continued US support for Ukraine's efforts.""We know the next weeks and months are going to be difficult and critical, especially for their own forces, and the United States is going to continue to stand by them,"" he said.One year ago, Biden was urgently warning a sometimes-skeptical world that a massive buildup of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders was the precursor to war. At the time, even some inside his own government questioned the ability of the Ukrainians to withstand an invasion, predicting the imminent fall of the capital Kyiv.Instead, Ukrainian fighters have held the capital and continue to resist Russian attempts to control territory, helped by a massive influx of Western weapons, ammunition and equipment. The war has become a grinding conflict that US officials say could last for months or even years.It has come to shape Biden's foreign policy, the fallout reverberating in the global economy and leading to newfound unity between the United States and its European allies.Biden's aides have been planning for several weeks how they will mark the anniversary of the invasion, including potentially a major address. They hope to emphasize the resilience of the Ukrainian people while stressing the importance of unity in the uncertain months ahead.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is currently preparing for an expected Russian offensive in the spring, appealing to Western governments for additional assistance and weaponry to help sustain the fight.He visited London, Paris and Brussels this week to deliver his requests in person, a rare trip outside his country that lent his appeals new urgency. Zelensky made his first trip outside Ukraine to Washington late last year, meeting Biden in the Oval Office and delivering remarks to Congress.His principal request has been more advanced weapons, including fighter jets and tanks, which he says are needed to stave off Russian advances. While the British and French leaders have sounded open to sending jets, Biden responded ""no"" last month when asked if he would send US F-16s.He did agree last month to prove sophisticated M1 Abrams tanks and has already provided Patriot missile defense systems.Vice President Kamala Harris is also expected to be in Europe this month attending the Munich Security Conference, where the war in Ukraine will be the top subject of discussion among world leaders.Poland is a key NATO ally currently housing thousands of American troops that also serves as a hub for Western weapons transfers to Ukraine. US service members are also training Ukrainian troops there.Biden last visited the country in March, traveling near the Ukraine border to visit with US and Polish troops. He also met with refugees fleeing Ukraine after the invasion.In a major speech delivered from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden said for the first time that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" edging toward calling for regime change in Moscow."

221,"After recent student fentanyl overdoses in Texas community, court documents reveal drug supplier lived blocks away from schools",https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/us/texas-student-fentanyl-overdoses/index.html,"The students, who range in age from 13 to 17 and are not identified by name in court documents, overdosed between September 18, 2022 and February 1, 2023. Three of the students died, and one of the students, a 14-year-old girl, overdosed twice, according to a statement by the US Attorney's Office, Northern District of Texas. Law enforcement officers traced the drugs the students overdosed on to a house within walking distance from a middle school and a high school, court documents say. ""First with all the school shootings, now this with drugs,"" Lupe Rebadan, who has two children, as well as nieces and nephews, attending schools in the district told CNN. ""Our kids are not safe at school... When is this all going to stop?"" Luis Eduardo Navarette and Magaly Mejia Cano have been charged with conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, according to the US Attorney's Office. ""To deal fentanyl is to knowingly imperil lives. To deal fentanyl to minors -- naive middle and high school students -- is to shatter futures. These defendants' alleged actions are simply despicable,"" US Attorney Leigha Simonton said in the statement.The complaint illuminates a network of drug dealers and users, most of them teenagers who attend R.L. Turner High School, Dan Long Middle School and Dewitt Perry Middle School, and traced the proliferation of fentanyl tainted ""M30"" pills to Navarette and Cano's residence. International drug trafficking organizations often produce M30 pills by mixing highly addictive fentanyl with acetaminophen ""and other binder type substances and pressed into various tablets/pills,"" says an affidavit by a Drug Enforcement Administration task force officer included in the criminal complaint.Many fake pills are made to look like prescription opioids such as oxycodone (Oxycontin, Percocet), hydrocodone (Vicodin), and alprazolam (Xanax); or stimulants like amphetamines (Adderall),"" according to the DEA's ""One Pill Can Kill"" website.Criminal organizations, according to the DEA officer's affidavit, sell M30 pills for $1 to $2 dollars per pill when the purchasers buy in bulk amounts. Those are later sold to ""street level dealers"" for $3 to $5 per pill, and later sold to consumers for $10 per pill.Law enforcement tracked multiple teenagers engaging in ""hand-to-hand transactions"" with Navarette and Cano outside of their house, which is approximately five blocks from R.L. Turner High School and two blocks from DeWitt Perry Middle School, the court documents reveal.On January 12, a Carrollton Street Crimes Unit detective observed a 16-year-old obtain M30 pills from Navarette and Cano's residence. The teenager appeared to crush and snort a pill on their front porch, ""possibly package"" the drugs, then walk toward the high school, where he was enrolled, according to the complaint. The school was notified by law enforcement, and later that day a school resource officer located the teenager in a bathroom making a ""snorting sound"" and appearing intoxicated.Navarette and Cano made their initial appearances in court on Monday, Erin Dooley of the US Attorney's Office in Northern Texas told CNN. Naverette waived his right to a detention hearing and was ordered detained pending trial, and Cano had her detention hearing on Friday, she added. Attorneys for Navarette and Cano haven't responded to CNN's requests for comment. Days after the complaint outlining the 10 overdoses became available to the public, CFBISD released a statement expressing sorrow and concern over ""the loss of young lives.""The district explained how it has educated the community about the threat from fentanyl over the past several months. ""We will continue to work cooperatively with local law enforcement agencies to address this issue and to maximize safety on our campuses in every way possible. We believe if we work together as a community, we can avoid these tragedies,"" the district said.The district said Narcan, or naloxone, an emergency drug used to treat fentanyl overdoses, had been obtained for all district facilities in October and random canine searches were being conducted on secondary campuses.Drug awareness presentations for parents will also resume this year, according to the district. 'Our students are dying from this'""The fentanyl crisis is claiming far too many young Texans,"" Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted Wednesday. Abbott launched the #OnePillKills campaign in October 2022 to ""combat the growing national fentanyl crisis plaguing Texas."" In the first week of school in 2022, four students died from ""fentanyl poisoning, or suspected poisoning"" in Hays County Independent School District (HCISD), located in a suburb of Austin. This prompted the district to create ""Fighting Fentanyl,"" an informational campaign warning students and faculty about the deadly drug.Tim Savoy, the chief communication officer at HCISD, noted that the district has spent tens of millions of dollars for preventative measures against school shootings and Covid-19, two issues that have affected schools nationwide. The fentanyl crisis on school campuses deserves the same level of concern and response, he said.""This is a threat. We're losing students, too. And so we made the decision that we have to get this equal attention and resources and do what we can,"" Savoy told CNN.Despite the district's awareness-raising campaign, an email from the superintendent on January 9 informed parents of ""three more suspected accidental fentanyl poisonings"" and one death in which fentanyl may have been to blame.""Our students are dying from this, and we have to do what we can,"" Savoy said. ""This is not just something that you're seeing elsewhere. This is really happening in our community.""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, median monthly overdose deaths among 10- to 19-year-olds across the United States involving illicitly manufactured fentanyl surged 182% from December 2019 to December 2021.     Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to fentanyl exposure due to the ""proliferation of counterfeit pills resembling prescription drugs containing IMFs (illicitly manufactured fentanyls), and the ease of purchasing pills through social media,"" according to the CDC."

""Have they explained why it wasn't allowed? No. It is frustrating but they will probably give an explanation later in the week. Today we haven't got one.""With Brentford trailing 1-0, Ivan Toney headed in a goal after the ball had bobbled around the penalty box from a free kick.The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) Lee Mason checked Ethan Pinnock's challenge on Gabriel during the initial free-kick but appeared to not use the VAR guidelines to check a second incident in the goal's build up when Christian Norgaard seemed to be offside.""You have to apply certain principles in defending and you do that by sticking to the rules. Suddenly you change the rules and then you have to change your principles,"" Arteta continued.""So tell us before so then you don't hold the (defensive) line that high. Because you're always going to have an advantage if you get blocked. You cannot block if you are offside.""Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the body responsible for Premier League referees, told CNN that its Chief Refereeing Officer Howard Webb had contacted Arsenal ""to acknowledge and explain the significant errors in the VAR process.""It added that the error was ""being thoroughly reviewed by PGMOL.""Arsenal's draw against Brentford marked the second consecutive week in which it dropped points following a shock loss against Everton, and its lead over Manchester City is now just three points, though City has played a game more.

The lawyers subsequently handed the materials over to the Justice Department.A Trump aide had previously copied those same pages onto a thumb drive and laptop, not realizing they were classified, sources said. The laptop, which belonged to an aide, who works for Save America PAC, and the thumb drive were also given to investigators in January.Special counsel Jack Smith's investigation, which is pursuing possible criminal charges related to Trump's handling of national security records and obstruction of justice, had subpoenaed Trump last May for all classified records in his possession.FBI agents seized classified documents and other presidential records during a search last August. The Trump team also found additional documents in a Florida storage facility and turned them over to the FBI. The discovery of two documents with classified markings in the storage unit was made after a team hired by Trump's lawyers searched it along with three other Trump properties: Trump Tower in New York, the Bedminster golf club and an office location in Florida.Those four searches came amid lingering concerns from the Justice Department that not all of the documents from Trump's time in the White House had been returned to the federal government.CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more clearly describe what the Trump team turned over to investigators."
224,FBI conducting search of former Vice President Mike Pence's home | CNN Politics,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/mike-pence-house-fbi-search/index.html,"Six ""additional pages without such markings that were not discovered in the initial review by the vice president's counsel"" were also removed, O'Malley said.Pence is currently on the West Coast with his family after the birth of two grandchildren, according to his spokesperson.The FBI is also expected to search Pence's office in Washington, DC, in the coming days, sources told CNN.The search comes after the FBI and the Justice Department's National Security Division launched a review of the documents and how they ended up in Pence's house. It is not yet clear what the documents are related to or their level of sensitivity or classification. On Thursday, Pence was also subpoenaed by special counsel Jack Smith, who is investigating former President Donald Trump and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Trump's legal team is expected to assert executive privilege over some aspects of Pence's subpoenaed testimony, according to a source familiar with the legal strategy. The Pence team, in talks with the Justice Department ahead of the search, expressed that they wanted to completely cooperate. The Pence team does not believe there are classified documents either at his home or at his office as they conducted what they considered an extensive search themselves, a source said. Pence has previously acknowledged that ""mistakes were made,"" as he took responsibility for classified documents ending up in his home and pledged to would ""fully cooperate"" with any FBI investigation. He said that the found documents had been ""immediately"" secured and the National Archives was notified. CNN first reported last month that Pence had discovered classified documents at his Carmel, Indiana, home after he instructed an attorney to search his records out of an ""abundance of caution"" following news of Biden's classified documents. His attorney, Matt Morgan, found about a dozen documents marked as classified in four boxes that came from Pence's vice presidential residence and his White House office. Pence's team notified the Archives of the discovery, and Archives officials notified the FBI. The FBI requested that Pence immediately turn over the classified documents and he agreed. The four boxes of unclassified material was driven to Washington so the Archives could review it for compliance with the Presidential Records Act, the law that requires all presidential documents are handed over to the Archives at the end of an administration. The roughly 12 classified documents included materials described as background briefing memos that were prepared for Pence's foreign trips, and sources described the classification markings as on the ""lower level."" The boxes in question had not gone through the thorough procedures Pence's office had in place for documents because they were packed at the last minute, sources said. Biden's team discovered classified documents at his Washington, DC, think tank office in November. Biden has said they immediately notified the National Archives, which then notified DOJ, but the discovery was not made public for weeks. Materials were also found at Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, residence. On Wednesday, FBI agents also searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and did not discover any additional classified documents. The FBI retrieved hundreds of documents from Trump's Florida residence last August after he failed to comply with a subpoena to hand over classified material. Trump had more than 300 classified documents in his possession at Mar-a-Lago that were turned over to the Archives and retrieved by the FBI. This story has been updated with additional details."
225,Biden ordered military to 'down' a 'high-altitude object' over US waters,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/biden-alaska-military-down/index.html,"The announcement -- marking the second time American fighter jets have taken down an object flying over US airspace in a little less than a week -- comes after the administration was subjected to a slew of questions about the timing of Biden's decision to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina last Saturday. This time, the president took more decisive action to swiftly take down the object near Alaska, but key questions about the origin of the object and its functionality remain unanswered. After the object was first detected on Thursday, F-35 fighter jets were sent to up to investigate, according to a US official. The object, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said during a White House press briefing, was flying at an altitude of 40,000 feet and ""posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight.""Along with the effort by F-35s on Thursday, fighter aircraft also engaged with the object again Friday morning. Both engagements yielded ""limited"" information, Kirby told reporters.""We were able to get some fighter aircrafts up and around it before the order to shoot it down, and the pilots assessment was this was not manned,"" Kirby added.The president was first briefed Thursday night ""as soon as the Pentagon had enough information,"" Kirby said, adding that at the recommendation of the Pentagon, Biden ordered the military ""to down the object -- and they did."" The object was brought down by fighter aircraft assigned to US Northern Command. And US officials have said the object was taken down over frozen Arctic Ocean waters near the Canadian border, about 10 miles off the north coast of Alaska. The US expects to recover the debris, Kirby said.Biden, asked later on Friday if he had any comment on the object shot down over Alaska, told CNN, ""It was a success.""An F-22 fighter jet from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska took down the object ""at 1:45 p.m. eastern standard time today, within US sovereign airspace over US territorial water,"" Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Friday.He said the object was shot down by the F-22 with an AIM-9X, the same type of aircraft and missile used to shoot down the balloon off the coast of South Carolina.A US official noted there was not a serious concern about collateral damage to people or property on the ground when the decision to shoot it down was made. US Northern Command and NORAD wanted to shoot down the object during the daytime because the brief hours of sunlight in the far north made it easier to spot for a fast-moving jet trying to find and follow a slow-moving object, the official said.The object did not appear to have any surveillance equipment, according to a US official, which would make it both smaller and likely less sophisticated than the Chinese balloon shot down last weekend.Military officials have expressed confidence that the object was not an asset belonging to the US military or government. Small object that posed a threat to civilian flightsRyder said that the Defense Department had no details about the object's ""capabilities, purpose or origin."" He added the object posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight, noting that ""the object was about the size of a small car, so not similar in size or shape to the high altitude surveillance balloon that was taken down off the coast of South Carolina on February 4.""US Northern Command's Alaska Command coordinated the operation with assistance from the Alaska Air National Guard, Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Ryder said. The object brought down over Alaska was much smaller than the Chinese surveillance balloon downed over territorial waters on Saturday. The payload of the Chinese balloon downed last Saturday was described by US officials as approximately the size of three buses, whereas the high-altitude object taken down on Friday has been described as being the size of a small car. The US has not attributed the second flying object to any country or entity. ""We're calling this an object because that's the best description we have right now. We don't know who owns it -- whether it's state-owned or corporate-owned or privately-owned, we just don't know,"" Kirby said.The object ""did not appear to be self-maneuvering, and therefore, (was) at the mercy of prevailing winds,"" making it ""much less predictable,"" said Kirby.The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary flight restriction Friday in the area around Deadhorse, Alaska, as the military took action against the object.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that he had supported the decision to take down the object. ""This afternoon, an object that violated American airspace was brought down. I was briefed on the matter and supported the decision to take action. Our military and intelligence services will always work together, including through @NORADCommand, to keep people safe,"" Trudeau tweeted. Since news broke last week about the Chinese balloon that was floating over US airspace, new details have emerged about what's now understood to be a global surveillance operation by China's military, the People's Liberation Army. On Thursday, officials revealed that they believe the spy balloons the US has discovered are part of a large fleet that is conducting surveillance operations globally. The US has traced the balloons to 40 countries across five continents.The US has developed a method to track China's spy balloon fleet within the last year, CNN reported exclusively on Friday. This story has been updated with additional developments."

227,Congressman who raised issue of antisemitism on Twitter says he was bombarded with antisemitic tweets,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/tech/congressman-antisemitism-twitter/index.html,"""What happened on Twitter directly after the hearing proves my exact point that antisemitism is real and Twitter has become a hate-filled playground for Nazis and anti-Semites,"" Rep. Jared Moskowitz told CNN about the hateful comments he received.At the hearing on Wednesday, which focused on Twitter's handling of a New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop in the leadup to the 2020 election, the Florida Democrat criticized his Republican counterparts for saying ""God bless Elon Musk."" Moskowitz asked: ""God bless the guys who is allowing Nazis and antisemitism to perpetuate on Twitter?"" He also cited statistics from the Anti-Defamation League, stating there has been a more than 60% increase in antisemitic comments on Twitter since Musk took over the platform.Under Musk's leadership, Twitter has slashed its staff, relaxed some of its content moderation policies and reinstated a number of incendiary accounts that were previously banned. Those moves raised concerns that Musk's Twitter could contribute to a rise in public displays of hate and antisemitism offline. Musk, however, has repeatedly pushed back at claims that hate speech is rising on the platform. In December, for example, Musk claimed ""hate speech impressions,"" or the number of times a tweet containing hate speech has been viewed, ""continue to decline"" since his early days of owning the company.Twitter, which eliminated much of its public relations team during last year's layoffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Moskowitz and many other Democrats on the subpanel used their allotted time to grill the former Twitter executives testifying at the hearing about the company's policies for policing hate on the platform. During his questioning, Moskowitz also rebuked former President Donald Trump for hosting white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago last year. He brought a large copy of a hateful post that Fuentes had tweeted at Moskowitz, telling the room, ""No, not all Republicans are Nazis, but I gotta tell you, Nazis seem really comfortable with Donald Trump. So I have questions about that."" In his letter to Musk, Moskowitz said he shared a clip showing his line of questioning on his official government Twitter account, after which ""the reply section of my post was flooded with hateful, antisemitic comments and images."" He added: ""At the time that I am writing this letter, I have received over 200 such comments on one tweet. This does not include other posts of mine that have since received antisemitic comments, including a video honoring the victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting.""Moskowitz pointed to a November 30 National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin warning from the Department of Homeland Security, which ""issued domestic terror threats to multiple groups, including the Jewish community,"" as evidence of his heightened concern. ""DHS notes that threat actors have recently mobilized to violence, and there is an 'enduring threat' to the Jewish community,"" he writes.""With this direct and heightened threat environment in mind, how will you work with other stakeholders to combat the rise of antisemitism on Twitter?,"" Moskowitz concludes in his letter to Musk.Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, echoed Moskowitz's concerns.""Antisemitism has no place on any social media platform that doesn't want to further the harassment and exclusion of marginalized communities,"" Greenblatt told CNN Thursday. ""While Twitter ostensibly has an anti-hate policy that includes antisemitism, it is unclear the degree to which it is being enforced.""Greenblatt said the ADL continues to flag ""batches of antisemitic content"" to Twitter, but he said the company has only taken action on ""a fraction of them"" since Musk acquired the company. He also raised concerns about the staff cuts and the reinstated accounts that were banned previously. ""These findings, combined with Twitter gutting its trust and safety operations, suggest serious issues will continue to persist on the platform as it pertains to effective content moderation and the proliferation of antisemitism,"" Greenblatt said."
228,Is the iPhone's 'Made in India' era about to begin?,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/tech/india-apple-iphone-manufacturing-china-rival-intl-hnk/index.html,"And Beijing's big regional rival isn't missing a beat in talking up the opportunity. One of India's top ministers said last month the California-based company wants to ramp up its production in the South Asian country to a quarter of its overall total. Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said Apple was already making between 5% and 7% of its products in India. ""If I am not mistaken, they are targeting to go up to 25% of their manufacturing,"" he said at an event in January.His comments come at a time when Foxconn (HNHPF), a top Apple supplier, is looking to expand its operations in India after suffering severe supply disruptions in China. For years, Apple had relied on a vast manufacturing network in China to mass produce iPhones, iPads and other popular products. But its dependence on the country was tested last year by Beijing's strict zero-Covid strategy, which was rapidly dismantled last December. Since the middle of last year, Apple has redoubled its efforts to invest in India. But can Asia's third largest economy deliver? ""Theoretically, it can be done, but it won't be happening overnight,"" said Tarun Pathak, a research director at market research firm Counterpoint. ""[Apple's] dependency on China is a result of almost two and a half decades of what China put in to develop their entire electronics manufacturing ecosystem,"" Pathak said, adding that the company makes nearly 95% of its phones in China. Apple did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.China headaches mountBut the world's most valuable company posted shockingly weak earnings this month, partly because of its recent problems in China. The troubles started in October, when workers began fleeing the world's biggest iPhone factory, run by Foxconn, over a Covid outbreak. Short on staff, Foxconn offered bonuses to workers to return. But violent protests broke out in November, when newly-hired staff said management had reneged on their promises. Workers clashed with security officers, before the company eventually offered them cash to quit and leave the site.While operations at the sprawling campus in Zhengzhou, central China, have now returned to normal, the supply problems hit the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models during the key holiday shopping season.Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.On top of that, US-China relations are looking increasingly tense. Last year, the Biden administration banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license.""I think they will continue to depend on China for a significant proportion of their production,"" said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School, referring to Apple.""But what they are trying to do, and I think it makes sense, is to add diversity to their supply base so that if something goes wrong in China, they will have some alternatives.""Shih referred to this strategy as ""China +1 or China+ more than one.""China+1= India?""India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a recent earnings call.""Looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year and so we feel very good about how we performed,"" he said.India is set to overtake China this year to become the world's most populous country. The country's massive and cheap labor force, which includes workers with key technical skills, is a big draw for manufacturers. Asia's third largest economy also offers a growing domestic market. In 2023, as global recession fears persist, India is expected to remain the fastest growing major economy in the world. If it can sustain that momentum, India could become only the third country with GDP worth $10 trillion by 2035, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research.Analysts say India's growing consumer base might give it an edge over Vietnam, which has also been attracting greater investment in electronics manufacturing.The Indian government has rolled out policies to attract investments in mobile phone manufacturing. According to Counterpoint's Pathak, India accounts for 16% of the global smartphone production, while China constitutes 70%. There are some success stories: Samsung, the world's top selling smartphone brand, is one step ahead of Apple and already makes a lot of its phones in India. The South Korean giant has been diversifying away from China because of rising labor costs and also stiff local competition from homegrown players such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi. It now makes the bulk of its phones in Vietnam and India, with the latter accounting for 20% of Samsung's global production.  In 2018, Samsung opened what it called ""the world's largest mobile factory"" in Noida, a city near New Delhi, and analysts say the the company may have paved the way for other manufacturers. Apple devices are manufactured in India by Taiwan's Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron. Until recently, the company would typically start assembling models in the country only seven to eight months after launch. That changed last year, when Apple started making new iPhone 14 devices in India weeks after they went on sale.Some of Apple's biggest contractors are already pumping more money into India. Last year, Foxconn announced it had invested half a billion dollars in its Indian subsidiary.Earlier this week, the government of the southern Indian state of Karnataka said it is ""in serious discussion of investment plans"" with the Taiwanese giant. Foxconn already has factories in the Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.Where is India's Shenzhen?Manufacturing in India, however, comes with myriad challenges. It constitute only 14% of India's GDP, according to the World Bank, and the government has struggled to grow that figure. ""One of the things that China did is they built infrastructure when they could. And I would argue that India did not build infrastructure when they could,"" said Shih, referring to highways, ports and transport links that allow easy movement of goods. Apple will also face a lot more red tape in India if it wants to create sprawling Chinese-style campuses. ""Will India be able to replicate a Shenzhen version?"" asked Pathak, referring to China's manufacturing hub. Building such ""hotspots"" won't be easy and would require India to think about issues ranging from logistics and infrastructure to the availability of workers, he added.Experts told CNN that accessing land in a chaotic democracy like India could be a challenge, while the Chinese Communist Party faces fewer barriers to expropriating real estate quickly for causes it deems important. India would also have to think about moving beyond simply assembling iPhones through favorable government policies.""You need to source components locally, which means you need to attract many more companies in the supply chain to set up shop in India,"" Pathak said. Some of the biggest businesses in India may be stepping up. According to Bloomberg, autos-to-airline conglomerate Tata Group is in talks with Wistron to take over the Taiwanese company's factory in southern India. Tata and Wistron did not respond to request for comment.""I am not directly involved in that, but it should be really good for India because this is going to create an opportunity in India to manufacture electronics and microelectronics,"" N. Ganapathy Subramaniam, COO of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's software services arm, told Bloomberg. While there are significant obstacles in India's ambition to deepen its relationship with Apple, doing so would be a huge boost for the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.'I think it'll be [a] big, big win,"" said Pathak, noting that growing manufacturing ties with a US giant like Apple will in turn attract other global players in the electronics manufacturing ecosystem to India.

Deadly encounter in Memphis comes at a critical time in American policing,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/us/tyre-nichols-memphis-police-law-enforcement/index.html,"Nichols died three days after the January 7 traffic stop and subsequent fatal encounter captured on video and principally involving five officers with two to six years on the job. The death of the 29-year-old Black man comes at a critical juncture in American law enforcement, as departments across the country -- including the Memphis PD -- struggle to recruit qualified officers and fill shifts, lure candidates with signing bonuses worth thousands of dollars, and at times curtail standards and training in a desperate bid to strengthen patrols amid rising gun violence, according to law enforcement experts. ""That is a recipe for disaster,"" said Kenneth Corey, a retired NYPD chief who once ran the training division. ""We've seen it happen before. You couldn't fill seats. You lowered standards. And now you've got scandal and use of force. And when you look at the individuals involved you say, we never would have hired this guy once upon a time."" Officers were part of specialized unit now disbandedIn the weeks since authorities released video of Nichols' brutal beating, little information has come out about the recruitment and training of the five former officers facing murder charges -- Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Justin Smith, Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills Jr.The five men were part of a now disbanded specialized street crime unit formed just over a year ago as part of the city's strategy to combat rising violence. The SCORPION unit focused on homicides, robberies, assaults and other felonies.Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said Nichols' killing raises questions about ""how those officers were trained and supervised and selected."" ""Over time you always want to look at the backgrounds of those officers -- that will be important. The hiring process -- that will be important,"" he said. ""In this case we don't know enough yet.""  Bean, 24, was commissioned as an officer in January 2021, personnel records show. His attorney has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.Haley, 30, was commissioned as an officer in January 2021, the records show. He is a former correctional officer. His attorney has not respond to requests for comment. Martin, 30, joined the department in 2018, according to the records. He will plead not guilty, according to his attorney, William Massey, who said: ""No one out there that night intended for Tyre Nichols to die.""Mills, 32, a former jailer in Mississippi and Tennessee, joined the department as a recruit in March 2017, the records show. He, too, plans to plea not guilty, said Blake Ballin, his attorney, who described Mills as ""devastated"" and ""remorseful."" Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn ""CJ"" Davis told CNN last month that Nichols' death was indicative of ""a gap somewhere"" in the specialized street crime unit.""We train and we retrain these officers, just like specialized units around the country,"" she said. ""These officers working in specialized units, you always need to make sure that the supervision is there and present.""On January 28, one day after the release of the video, Memphis PD announced that it had permanently disbanded the unit. Davis said the department was unaware of any evidence the unit had previously engaged in misconduct but added that an investigation is ongoing.The five former Memphis officers charged in Nichols' death also are accused of assaulting another young Black man just three days before the fatal police encounter, according to a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday.The suit accuses the city of failing to prevent or address an alleged pattern of policing abuses by the SCORPION unit, which it claims operated like a ""gang of vigilantes"" without adequate training or supervision. Police declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing ongoing litigation.The Shelby County District Attorney's office in Memphis said it will review all cases involving the five officers charged with Nichols' death.  Davis, speaking at a Memphis city council meeting Tuesday, said training was not an issue with the unit. Instead, she said, ""egos"" and a ""wolf pack mentality"" contributed to the killing. ""Culture is not something that changes overnight. You know, there is a saying in law enforcement that 'culture eats policy for lunch.' We don't want to just have good policies because policies can be navigated around,"" she said. ""We want to ensure that we have the right people in place to ensure our culture is evolving.""Bonuses offered and hiring standards loosenedNichols' death comes as many police departments in the US have been reeling from an exodus of officers due to resignations and retirements and scrambling to attract new recruits. The staffing crisis has been exacerbated by high-profile cases such as the 2020 murder of George Floyd that have put policing under scrutiny and made it a frequent target of protests and moves to decrease funding.""The pandemic impacted recruiting and then George Floyd's murder really was a moment in time that made prospective police applicants think twice -- Is this a job for me?"" Wexler said.  ""And now, unfortunately, with the Tyre Nichols killing you simply compounded what was already arguably a challenging environment to hire a police officer."" Wexler's group, in a 2021 survey, found that retirements had risen 45% that year since 2019. Resignations had jumped 18% in that two-year period. The number of officers on the Memphis Police Department dropped by more than 22% since 2011 -- from 2,449 in September 2011 to a low of 1,895 officers last December, according to the Memphis Data Hub website.  The department was budgeted for 2,300 officers last year, CNN affiliate WMC reported. In 2015, nearly 200 Memphis police officers resigned over changes to pension and benefit plans, according to WMC. ""It had gotten to the point that we were having sergeants as acting lieutenants,"" said Alvin Davis, a former Memphis police lieutenant and recruiter who retired last year. ""Hundreds of people did it over a period of time because we didn't have enough supervisors. So many people were running out the door."" Like other departments around the country, the Memphis PD in 2021 began offering $15,000 signing bonuses and $10,000 in relocation assistance. Additionally, requirements on college credits, military experience and employment history have been loosened, WMC reported. ""Departments around the country ... are offering between $25,000 and $30,000 signing bonuses,"" Wexler said. ""You've got a national shortage of applicants which has forced police departments to do unprecedented things like offering signing bonuses and, in some cases, modifying the standards for hiring."" Greg Umbach, associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said there is a direct correlation between higher standards for new recruits and lower incidents of bad behavior.""We know from decades of research that the number of cops meeting higher qualifications, most notably a college degree, matters far more than anything else, for the number of civilian complaints a department gets,"" Umbach said.And if the pipeline of good officers is low, Umbach said, then so is the quality of supervision -- a reality that has plagued the Memphis Police Department and other agencies nationwide. ""Any police sergeant watching that video, their first thought is, 'My God, where was the supervision and why did they think this was okay,'"" Umbach said.'It's not that kind of job anymore'Davis, the former lieutenant and recruiter, asked a similar question about supervision.""If you pepper-spray someone or you tase someone, you're supposed to call a supervisor,"" said Davis, who spent 22 years on the job. ""That's just policy. Why they didn't, I can't say."" But, Davis said, the behavior of the former officers who beat Nichols did not entirely surprise him -- given the curtailed training and standards, shortage of skilled supervisors and growing number of officers lured by monetary incentives and without the requisite experience being deployed on the city's streets. ""The standards kept dropping and dropping to bring people in,"" said Davis, who was in charge of recruiting. ""And then they start throwing money out to lure people in and this is what you got.""He added, ""Just about everybody who came, the first thing they asked us was about was the money. How long did they have to stay on the job? Do I have to do a year? Two years? Nobody is trying to make a career out of it. It was the money."" The Memphis PD did not immediately respond to a request for comment on training, recruitment and staffing issues.""It's not the job that it used to be, when you felt like you're the 'best in blue' and you have your head up because you really feel like you accomplished something,"" said Davis, referring to the Memphis Police Department's longtime ""Join the best in blue"" recruitment campaign. ""It's not that kind of job anymore."" 'Lessons of history' out of Miami and DCIt's too early to tell exactly what factors contributed to the behavior of the former officers who beat Nichols to death on January 7, law enforcement experts said.  Wexler and others pointed to previous policing scandals that were preceded by periods of hiring under lax standards and curtailed training. In the late 1980s, nearly 10% of the officers in the Miami Police Department were suspended or fired after a corruption scandal involving rogue officers who became known as the ""River Cops."" Nearly 20 former officers were convicted on various state and federal charges, including using their police powers as a racketeering enterprise to commit murder. In 1990, an investigation into the hiring and training of police officers in Washington, DC by the General Accounting Office found that a hiring rush during the previous decade -- prompted by a wave of drug and gun violence -- led to cutting corners on recruiting, background checks and training.Eight years later, another report by the GOA, the investigative arm of Congress, examined drug-related police corruption and said ""rapid recruitment initiatives"" coupled with loosening education requirements and inadequate training and supervision ""might have permitted the hiring of recruits who might not otherwise have been hired.""""These are all lessons of history,"" said Corey, the former NYPD chief. ""You have to make the profession attractive to the type of people you want to recruit. It's not that people have lost interest in policing. They just don't see it as a viable occupation.""He added, ""What we ask of our cops is that they think like lawyers, speak like psychologists, and perform like athletes but we pay them as common laborers. A starting officer in New York City makes $42,000 a year, which means about $20 dollars an hour. It also means that at McDonald's they could be making $15 dollars an hour with none of the stress, trauma or risk."""
