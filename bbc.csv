Those living here on the Syrian side may have been displaced by the country's more than decade-old civil war. But they could also be survivors of the earthquake. Catastrophes overlap in Syria. The earthquake, untroubled by international borders, has brought havoc to both countries. But the international relief effort has been thwarted by checkpoints. In southern Turkey, thousands of rescue workers with heavy lifting gear, paramedics and sniffer dogs have jammed the streets, and are still working to find survivors. In this part of opposition-held north-west Syria, none of this is going on. I had just crossed the border from four days in the city of Antakya, Turkey, where the aid response is a cacophony - ambulance sirens blare all night long, dozens of earth movers roar and rip apart concrete 24 hours a day. Among the olive groves in the village of Bsania, in Syria's Idlib province, there's mostly silence.The homes in this border area were newly built. Now more than 100 have gone, turned to aggregate and a ghostly white dust which gusts across the farmland. As I climb over the chalky remains of the village, I spot a gap in the ruin. Inside, a pink-tiled bathroom sits perfectly preserved. The earthquake swallowed Abu Ala's home, and claimed the lives of two of his children. ""The bedroom is there, that's my house,"" he says, pointing to pile of rubble. ""My wife, daughter and I were sleeping here - Wala', the 15-year-old girl, was at the edge of the room towards the balcony. A bulldozer was able to find her, [so] I took her and buried her."" In the dark, he and his wife clung to olive trees as aftershocks rocked the hillside. The Syrian Civil Defence Force - also known as the White Helmets - which operates in opposition-held areas, did what they could with pickaxes and crowbars. The rescuers, who receive funding from the British government, lack modern rescue equipment.Abu Ala' breaks down when he describes the search for his missing 13-year-old son, Ala'. ""We kept digging until evening the next day. May God give strength to those men. They went through hell to dig my boy up."" He buried the boy next to his sister. Bsania wasn't much, but it was home. Rows of modern apartment buildings, with balconies facing out across the Syrian countryside into Turkey. Abu Ala' describes it as a thriving community. ""We had nice neighbours, nice people. [They] are dead now.""A deeply religious man, he is now bereft. ""What am I going to do?"" he asks. ""There are no tents, no aid, nothing. We've received nothing but God's mercy until now. And I'm here left to roam the streets."" As we leave, he asks me if I have a tent. But we have nothing to give him. I meet up with the White Helmets, expecting to find them looking for survivors. But it is too late. Ismail al Abdullah, is weary from effort, and what he describes as the world's disregard for the Syrian people. He says the international community has blood on its hands. ""We stopped looking for survivors after more than 120 hours passed,"" he says. ""We tried our best to save our people, but we couldn't. No-one listened to us. ""From the first hour we called for urgent action, for urgent help. No-one responded. They were just saying, 'We are with you', nothing else. We said, we need equipment. No-one responded."" Apart from a few Spanish doctors, no international aid teams have reached this part of Syria. It is an enclave of resistance from Bashar al-Assad's rule. Under Turkish protection, it is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist group that was once affiliated to al-Qaeda. The group has cut those links, but almost all governments have no relations with them. For our entire time in Syria, armed men, who didn't want to be filmed, accompanied us and stood at a distance. More than a decade into Syria's stalled civil war, the 1.7m people who live in this area continue to oppose President Assad's rule. They live in makeshift camps and newly built shelters. Most have been displaced more than once, so life here was already very hard before the earthquake. The international help that reaches this part of Syria is tiny. Many of the earthquake victims were taken to the Bab al-Hawa hospital, which is supported by the Syrian American Medical Society. They treated 350 patients in the immediate aftermath, general surgeon Dr Farouk al Omar tells me, all with only one ultrasound. When I ask him about international aid, he shakes his head, and laughs. ""We cannot talk more about this topic. We spoke about that a lot. And nothing happened. Even in a normal situation, we don't have enough medical staff. And just imagine what it's like in this catastrophe after earthquake,"" he says. At the end of the corridor, a tiny baby lies in an incubator. Mohammad Ghayyath Rajab's skull is bruised and bandaged, and his small chest rises and falls thanks to a respirator. Doctors can't be sure, but they think he's around three months old. Both of his parents were killed in the earthquake, and a neighbour found him crying alone in the dark in the rubble of his home. The Syrian people have been forsaken many times, and tell me they have grown used to being disregarded. But still there is anger that more help is not forthcoming. In the town of Harem, Fadel Ghadab lost his aunt and cousin. ""How is it possible that the UN has sent a mere 14 trucks worth of aid?"" he asks. ""We've received nothing here. People are in the streets."" More aid has made it into Syria, but not much and it is too little, too late. In the absence of international rescue teams in Harem, children remove rubble. A man and two boys use a car-jack to prize apart the collapsed remains of a building, carefully salvaging animal feed onto a blanket. Life isn't cheaper in Syria, but it is more precarious.The day is ending and I have to leave. I cross the border back into Turkey and soon get stuck in a traffic jam or ambulances, construction equipment - the gridlock of a national and international aid response. My phone pings with a message from a Turkish rescuer telling me his team found a woman alive after 132 hours buried under her home. Behind me in Syria, as darkness falls, there is only silence.

1,Cyclone Gabrielle: New Zealand braces for storm after record floods,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64608532,"Thousands of people in New Zealand have been left without power as parts of the country endure the start of a severe storm.Gabrielle buffeted Australia's Norfolk Island overnight and has begun to lash the northernmost region of New Zealand.Forecasters have issued ""red"" heavy wind and rain warnings for Auckland and Northland with 200mm of rain and winds of up to 130kph (80mph) expected.Evacuation centres have been set up and residents have been preparing.They have been told to ensure they have enough supplies to last three days in case they are trapped at home.The storm - which has been downgraded from a cyclone - comes weeks after torrential rain inundated the city of Auckland., which remains under a state of emergency.Tens of thousands of sandbags have been distributed there due to concerns the sodden ground and weakened infrastructure have made homes more vulnerable to flooding. Air New Zealand, the national carrier, has cancelled several domestic flights ahead of the storm's arrival. On Norfolk Island, which covers just over 34 sq km (13 sq miles) in the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand, authorities said they were clearing debris and trees from roads and restoring power knocked out in the storm.""There is still considerable clean up to be undertaken and it may take a while for services such as power to be restored,"" Emergency Management Norfolk Island said.New Zealand's MetService has warned winds could still be strong enough to damage trees and power lines and that enough rain could fall to cause further flooding and landslides in the coming days. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said: ""Our main message to people across the country is to please take the severe weather warning seriously and to make sure you're prepared.""Make sure you've got your grab-and-go kits, make sure you know where you need to go in the event you need to evacuate your homes.""Pak'nSave Royal, Oak pic.twitter.com/jPTXXwayr7The Coromandel Peninsula and the TairƒÅwhiti/Gisborne region, which were also affected by the recent torrential rain, have been placed under the most serious weather alert.Residents in flood-prone areas have been told to prepare to evacuate.""There's a degree of nervousness and anxiety around this coming event,"" the Thames-Coromandel district's mayor, Len Salt, told the Stuff news website.

2,Marina Ovsyannikova: Anti-war Russian journalist recounts dramatic escape,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64604233,"This video can not be playedWatch: Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV newsOne October night, a week before she was due to face trial for criticising Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova took her young daughter and fled for the border.She was wearing an electronic bracelet, and was meant to be under house arrest.""My lawyer said 'flee, flee - they're going to put you in prison',"" she said at a press conference in Paris on Friday.She left Moscow at the start of one weekend last year, when she judged that police would be less active, and changed vehicle seven times before approaching the border on foot.  ""Our [last] vehicle got stuck in the mud,"" she told me, ""and we had no mobile phone coverage - we tried to find our way by the stars. It was a very dangerous and stressful escape.""They wandered for hours near the border, she said, hiding from border patrols, before successfully making it across.Part of that success is down to the organisation Reporters Sans Fronti√®res (Reporters Without Borders). Its director, Christophe Deloire, explained how they helped her escape.""I wrote my first text message to Marina the day after she went on TV with that sign,"" he told me. ""I sent her a message saying: Do you need help? We are here for you.""  Last September, Ms Ovsyannikova sent a message to the organisation through an intermediary, asking for their help to leave.""We said, OK,"" explained Mr Deloire. ""[But] she's in Moscow under house arrest, her neighbours and family are Putinists - they could call the police and say she left - and she had an electronic bracelet. So there were many reasons [why] it was an incredibly difficult thing to escape. But she made it.""Now settled in Paris, Ms Ovsyannikova, 44, says she is still ""of course, afraid for her life"", but believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is risking his leadership over the war in Ukraine.""The elite understands everything perfectly,"" she explained.""The people are living in this bubble of propaganda, but the ruling elite - those who have lost their planes, their yachts, their finances - they understand everything. As soon as a Ukrainian victory gets closer, I believe, the ruling establishment will present Putin with a big bill.""Ms Ovsyannikova grabbed headlines around the world last March, when she burst into a live news broadcast at the state-run Channel One TV station where she worked at the time, with a sign reading ""no war, stop the war; don't believe the propaganda; they're lying to you here"".She said she was ""immediately isolated by the FSB [Russia's security service]"", and her bosses interrogated.As she collected her belongings from the office, she told me that ""I saw in my co-workers' eyes a totally compassionate expression. ""They were looking at me with wild eyes, they were saying goodbye. They thought they would never see me again.""Ms Ovsyannikova left Russia for Germany soon afterwards, but returned later that year - to fight for custody of her children, she says.Further protests, including a demonstration near the Kremlin in July, saw her facing charges under a new Russian law, banning ""deliberately false information"" about Russia's armed forces.  The law made it illegal to call the war an ""invasion,"" with Russian state-controlled news organisations instead told to describe it as a ""special military operation"".Despite being targeted by the Russian regime, many Ukrainian journalists and Russian dissidents have expressed mistrust of Ms Ovsyannikova, pointing to her earlier career as a mouthpiece for the Russian state.Her visit to Ukraine last summer to cover the war for Germany's Die Welt newspaper outraged many Ukrainians, who demanded her immediate sacking.Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV news.

3,Turkey earthquake rescue: How two sisters were saved from the rubble,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64612317,"This video can not be playedWatch: Rescuers use specialist cameras to free Irem And Merve from the rubble of their building in Antakya""Merve! Irem! Merve! Irem,"" rescue worker Mustafa Ozturk is shouting. Everyone around us has been ordered to be silent. The team are looking for two sisters who other survivors say are trapped alive under piles of rubble.With sensitive devices they listen for any response. Everyone is frozen in anticipation.And then, a breakthrough. ""Irem, my dear, I am close to you, you hear me, yes?"" Mustafa says. Those of us watching can't hear it, but it is clear now that she is responding. A small group of the girls' friends wait silently with us.""You are superb! Now you stay calm and answer me. Ah ok, that's Merve. Merve dear, just answer my questions,"" he says.Merve, 24, and her sister Irem, 19, were trapped under the rubble of their five-storey apartment block in Antakya, southern Turkey, which was flattened by the earthquake. It had been two days, but for them those days felt like weeks.""It's Wednesday. No! You weren't trapped for 14 days. Give us five minutes. You will be out.""Mustafa knows it will take hours, but tells us: ""If they lose their hope they might not survive.""Merve and Irem start to joke and laugh together. I can see a big smile on Mustafa's face: ""If they had space they would probably dance,"" he says.By the rescuers' calculations it is 2m (6.6 ft) to reach the sisters but Hasan Binay, the rescue team's commander, says digging a tunnel into the concrete is a very delicate operation. One wrong move could lead to a catastrophe.A bulldozer is called to very slightly lift and hold the thick concrete to stop the building collapsing when they start digging.""Girls, soon we will give you blankets."" Mustafa tells the sisters. ""Ah no, you don't worry about us. We are not tired or cold.""Mustafa says Merve is worried about the rescuers' situation. It is 20:30 local time and it is very cold. This area has had one of the coldest winters that people can remember.The rescuers start furiously digging and throwing the rubble away with their bare hands.But after a couple of hours we feel the ground suddenly shaking under our feet. It is a strong aftershock. Operations must stop and we leave the devastated building.""There is a brutal reality here. The safety of our team comes first,"" Hasan says.After 30 minutes, Mustafa and three other rescuers go back to where they were digging.""Don't be scared. Believe me we won't leave you here. I will bring you out and you will take us for a good lunch,"" Mustafa shouts. The girls thought they had been left to die.It is midnight now and the digging has resumed. The team have hardly slept for days. We have gathered around a small fire next to the building.Every so often there is a shout: ""sessizlik"", meaning silence. The light goes off, total darkness now. They have made a small hole in the concrete to see if the girls can see the light coming from Mustafa's torch.""Merve! Irem! Do you see the light? OK! Perfect! Now I am sending a small camera down. Once you see it tell me and I will tell you what to do.""It is a moment of elation for everyone. Hasan joins his team to see the girls on the small screen connected to their night vision camera. They can see both Irem and Merve.""You are so beautiful. Don't move too much. Irem pull the camera so we can see Merve better."" On the screen, we see that Irem is smiling. Luckily there is enough space for them between the concrete trapping them.Relief floods everyone's faces. The girls look well and at least Irem has room to pull herself out if they make the hole bigger.But almost immediately the team look concerned. Merve has told them that she has started to feel cold and there is something heavy on her feet.The medics were worried: ""Do Merve's feet have gangrene? Or is this the first symptom of hypothermia?""It is around 05:00 now. The tunnel is big enough for the slimmest team member to crawl down. The rescuer was able to reach and hold Irem's hand for a few moments.""Our mother's body has started to stink and we can't breathe properly,"" Irem tells the rescuers. The girls have been lying next to their dead mother for days.It is shocking. How awful that there can be moments in life when you would not want your mother next to you, we reflected.Hasan asks one of Merve's friends - still waiting, stressed and silent - to show them the picture she has of the girls. They are trying to estimate the width they need to make the hole. The two girls are smiling, in party dresses, celebrating a wedding.""Perfect! We can bring them out."" The medical team gets ready with thermal blankets and stretchers. Everyone is excited. It is 06:30 and Irem comes first. She is laughing and crying at the same time.""God bless you. Please bring Merve out too. Please,"" she begs the rescuers. ""Merve will follow. I promise,"" Hasan tells her.But bringing Merve out takes another tense 30 minutes. They need to free her feet from under the concrete without doing her harm. The operation is successful.Once Merve is out, everyone starts clapping and cheering. I hear Merve screaming in pain but then asking: ""Am I really alive?""""You are dear,"" Mustafa replies, smiling.The friends who have been here all night start shouting in tears. ""Merve! Irem! We are here. Don't be scared."" The sisters were loaded into ambulances and transferred to a field hospital.After this joyful moment comes a chilling one. The rescuers ask everyone to be silent again. This is the last call.""If anyone hears me, respond. If you can't respond, try to touch the ground.""Hasan repeats, imploringly, from different angles. Then sadly, with red spray he signs on the concrete, writing codes so other rescue teams will not search the building.""Rescuing a human being is a beautiful feeling, but we wish there were no deaths."" I can see the sadness in his face.""Will you eat lunch with Merve and Irem?"" I ask. He smiles: ""I hope one day we can. But the most important thing is that they are alive and in good hands now.""Quake failures leave Erdogan vulnerable in TurkeyQuake death toll tops 28,000 as rescue hopes dwindle"
4,The man who built a Hobbit house by accident,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-64511741,"Stuart Grant has spent decades transforming a ruined farm building into an ornately-decorated home which has been dubbed the Hobbit house.But the 90-year-old says that it was not his intention when he started work on the project in the 1980s.""It's all a mistake really. It was only meant to be temporary,"" said Stuart.""When I started doing it up I was just getting such a buzz doing it.""I got carried away and I ended up with this.""His little house is located in the woods in Glen Affric, in the Highlands.The great-grandfather bought the plot of land - which contained a derelict house and a dilapidated livestock shed, known as a byre - back in 1984.The properties had originally belonged to a shoemaker. Over the years, previous residents of the byre had included a cow, a donkey and a pig.Stuart, a skilled joiner, had intended to renovate the house and make it his home in the Highlands after two stints living and working in Australia, which amounted to a total of 14 years.But before starting work on the house, he decided to convert the byre into temporary accommodation.That stop-gap then become a labour of love.When he began, there were no doors. All that remained of the byre was its four walls and two entrances.He connected the property to mains electricity, but at the start his only household electrical appliance was a 100W bulb.Over the years Stuart has turned it into a cosy little home, largely using wood in its construction and furnishing it with items including a stove rescued from a scrapheap.He has also installed stained glass windows and carved owl heads into each step of a staircase. Stuart has many years' experience working with wood. His first job was as a woodcutter, back when Clydesdale horses were still used to haul timber out of Highland forests.He then served an apprenticeship as a joiner before working in sawmills in Scotland and Australia.The property's oval door and overall aesthetic has led to it being nicknamed the Hobbit house by neighbours and visitors.But Stuart told BBC Radio Scotland's Out of Doors programme this was ""just a coincidence"".He has not read JRR Tolkien's books The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, or seen any of the film or TV adaptations of the author's work.For Stuart, it is simply called home - and he believes it is nothing special.He is still working to convert the main house, but jokes that he will be 130 by the time that project is completed. Stuart is still working away on his projects, though concedes old age has slowed down the progress.And even after all his hard work to make the byre into a house, it still seems to be an attraction to livestock.Stuart added: ""The sheep in the neighbouring field sometimes get in here and I get woken by sheep jumping on my roof."""
5,"Why are BP, Shell, and other oil giants making so much money right now?",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64583982,"The big oil companies - from the UK-based BP and Shell to international giants such as ExxonMobil and Norway‚Äôs Equinor - have been announcing astonishing profit figures.They are all benefitting from the surging price of oil and gas following the invasion of Ukraine. While they rake in the profits, people around the world are struggling to pay their energy bills and fill up their cars - leading to calls for higher taxes on these companies.So how are they making so much money, and should the government step in to stop them?Oil and gas are traded around the world, and if supplies are short and demand high, sellers can charge more, and the price goes up.Before the Ukraine war, Russia was the world‚Äôs largest exporter of oil and natural gas.  A lot of the money that people paid to buy that oil and gas went to the Russian government - those exports made up 45% of the Russian government budget in 2021. After the invasion, Western countries, including the UK and EU, tried to stop (or at least massively reduce) their energy imports from Russia, to avoid funding the Russian military and supporting a hostile regime.Countries that didn‚Äôt want to buy from Russia had to pay much higher prices for oil produced elsewhere. Oil prices had already been rising as economies reopened following Covid-19 lockdowns, and people needed more oil. The day after the Russian invasion, the oil price went above $100 a barrel, and peaked at over $127 in March, before coming back down to around $85. Gas prices also soared after the invasion. Oil and natural gas are crucial to almost every aspect of modern life. Oil is used to make petrol and diesel, and natural gas is used for heating and cooking.They're also used in agriculture, electricity generation, and other industrial processes which make everything from fertilizer to plastics. So a sustained rise in oil and gas prices pushes up the cost of many other things we buy, driving the cost of living crisis that has gripped the UK - and other countries - in recent months.Oil companies make money by locating oil and gas reserves buried in rocks under the earth's surface, and drilling down to release them. The costs don‚Äôt vary that much as the price goes up or down, but the money they make from selling it does. So when oil prices soared after the invasion of Ukraine, the money these companies made from selling oil and gas massively increased as well.On Tuesday, BP reported record annual profits of $27.7bn (¬£23bn) for 2022, as it scaled back plans to reduce the amount of oil and gas it produces by 2030. Those profits were double the previous year's figure.In February, Shell reported its highest profits in 115 years. Profits hit $39.9bn (¬£32.2bn) in 2022, double the previous year's total.The profits they make don‚Äôt all disappear - lots of ordinary people own shares in BP, Shell, and other global oil companies. This may be via their pension funds, and they may not even be aware of it.Some of the extra profits are paid to shareholders through higher dividends, and buying back shares (which increases the share price).But as long as the billions roll in while customers struggle to pay their bills, the calls for higher taxes will continue. Big oil companies made their record profits even after paying billions to governments around the world.BP and Shell are in a complicated position because they are headquartered in the UK but produce a relatively small amount of oil and gas in UK waters. They make most of their profits from activities around the world.Shell paid $134m (¬£110m) tax on its UK operations in 2022, out of a worldwide tax bill of $13bn. BP paid $2.2bn (¬£1.8bn) in taxes on its UK operations, out of a global tax bill of $15bn.Oil companies already pay a tax on their profits from oil and gas production in the UK of 40% - which is higher than taxes on other companies. But they can reduce that tax bill by deducting the cost of shutting down old oil rigs, or offsetting future investments and losses from earlier years. In some years, BP and Shell have paid no tax on UK operations, and received payments from the UK government instead.After the invasion of Ukraine, the government faced calls to introduce an extra ""windfall tax"" on energy company profits to help pay for soaring energy bills. This was introduced in May 2022, and increased from 25% to 35% in November. It is now expected to raise around ¬£40bn extra from all the companies operating in UK waters between 2022 and 2028.However, the windfall tax only applies to the profits on UK oil and gas production, which only account for a small share of some firms' profits. And firms can deduct more than 90% of the cost of new exploration and production from their windfall tax bills, significantly reducing what they have to pay. The windfall tax accounted for all of Shell's UK tax bill, and $700m (¬£538m) of BP's.Politicians, environmentalists, trade unions and poverty campaigners have attacked oil companies‚Äô record profits, and argued for higher windfall taxes.They say high prices are the result of something beyond the oil firm's control - war, and that it's not fair that oil companies are profiting from people's suffering.Some say higher windfall taxes are a good way for governments to raise money because they're easy to collect and hard to avoid.Even the former boss of Shell himself, Ben van Beurden, wondered if it was inevitable that governments would need to tax energy producers more to protect the poorest in society.But oil firms argue that a higher windfall tax would make them less willing to invest in producing in the UK, and that they would search for oil elsewhere where taxes are lower. Harbour Energy, which produces more oil and gas in the UK than anyone else, is cutting jobs and reconsidering its UK investments because of the windfall tax.If the UK government decided to tax BP and Shell on their global profits more heavily, they could potentially move their headquarters out of the country - escaping the new tax, and depriving the UK of much of the revenues they currently pay.Oil companies have to operate in a world where the price of oil can go down as well as up, with little warning. Money made in the good years helps to balance out years when oil prices are low.Many oil companies lost billions from Russian investments last year - BP wrote off $24bn of investments in the Russian oil company Rosneft, for example. They also have to invest billions to find new reserves of oil to keep supplies running until the world switches over to renewable sources of power.Energy companies have a big role to play in that switch-over, too. BP and Shell invest some of the billions they make from oil and gas into renewable power such as solar and wind farms, and charging stations for electric cars.BP boss Bernard Looney said the British company was ""helping provide the energy the world needs"" while investing the transition to green energy.Shell chief executive Wael Sawan said that these are ""incredibly difficult times - we are seeing inflation rampant around the world"" but that Shell was playing its part by investing in renewable technologies. Its chief financial officer Sinead Gorman added that Shell had paid $13bn in taxes globally in 2022. However, BP scaled back its plans to cut its carbon emissions this year because demand for oil and gas is so strong.The energy price cap was introduced in 2019 to stop companies overcharging people who didn't shop around for cheaper deals. It targets energy suppliers, and doesn't affect the profits of oil and gas producers.BP scales back climate targets as profits hit recordShell reports highest profits in 115 yearsOil and gas firm blames job cuts on windfall tax"

7,"15 homes, just three survivors - the community lost under one Turkish apartment block",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64597007,"On an indistinct mound of rubble in southern Turkey is an uncannily well-preserved window frame with a butterfly print curtain that flutters in the cold wind.""It's Ceyda's room."" Before the earthquake, 19-year-old Ceyda Ocan looked through that window and those curtains, on to her street in the city of Iskenderun. Now her best friend Damla is on the street with her family to keep vigil at the fallen apartment block, hoping that Ceyda has survived, as rescue workers sift and dogs sniff for signs of life.Damla met Ceyda in the neighbourhood when she was six and Ceyda eight, and they stayed close. They bought those curtains together on a recent shopping trip. ""We both love butterflies,"" Damla says, weeping. On her phone is a picture of a birthday cake Ceyda organised for Damla with her sister, and in purple icing with butterfly decorations it says: ""Who loves you the most in the world? Us of course!""Ceyda's apartment block, called Orcan, sat in a row of mid-rise pink and beige buildings with small balconies, in the centre of Iskenderun, all with shops on the ground floor. When the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck at 04:17 on Monday, Ceyda would have been sleeping, along with the other residents of Orcan.The block crumpled with the force of the tremor.Many buildings in southern Turkey have been wiped out of existence this week, but this is the story of Orcan, home to Ceyda and her family alongside the residents of 14 other flats. In the days after the quake, their friends and family gathered round Orcan hoping for the best, and speaking of their loved ones.We witnessed one brief moment of elation on Wednesday when a survivor was pulled from the rubble after more than a day of digging - one of Ceyda's neighbours. According to rescuers and residents in the area, she managed to say that she had spoken to Ceyda through the fallen walls, and that Ceyda had said she was OK. But officials warned that the survivor was disorientated - it might not have actually happened. By Friday, there was no more news. We went back to Orcan for three days in a row to witness the informal rescue efforts, the people fleeing for safer places, and the field hospitals erected for survivors. Rescuers and neighbours all told us that they knew of three people who survived - the rest are unaccounted for.Those gathered said Orcan was home to a tight-knit community, where neighbours would frequently visit each other's homes for tea or strong Turkish coffee.Residents of Orcan and other buildings on the street had WhatsApp groups and arranged regular meet-ups. ""It was like, your place this week, yours next,"" one local man said. ""This is the Turkish way.""When asked what the neighbourhood was like, Damla's uncle Emrullah, who ran the local grocery shop, clasped his hands together. ""Like this,"" he said.Orcan has stood for decades. ""I'm 50 years old and I remember walking past it on my way to and from school,"" one man said.When the earthquake hit, locals told us the buildings on Orcan's row fell ""like dominoes"". On either side of the line of destruction, similar buildings appear unscathed and their residents spoke with both guilt and relief.Cansu, a local paramedic, knew several of the people who lived in Orcan. After the earthquake hit, she left her home and ran round the corner to the entrance of Ceyda's street, she said.The buildings along that row are now crumpled together in a mass of debris. Only a few traces of the residents inside are visible: a kite decorated with characters from the Disney film Frozen; a torn Quran; a squashed white oven; a red-rimmed clock, frozen in time.A man whose grandfather - a swimming enthusiast with a love for beer and stuffed peppers - lived in the building next door reached into the rubble beneath Ceyda's curtains and pulled out a phone. It was still working - and the background picture was his grandfather's face. The man smiled a bittersweet smile.A mother, 63-year-old Sehvar, and her non-verbal daughter Derya lived on the first floor of the apartment block.Family members watching the rescue efforts said the pair spent most of their time together at home, Sehvar caring for her daughter.""Even if she is alive and hears the sounds asking if anyone is out there, she will not be able to answer,"" said Derya's sister Deniz, who travelled from her home some two hours away to be at the wreckage.On the same floor, on the other side of the building, lived university graduate Berk. One man said he was often seen around the neighbourhood drinking Coca-Cola, and joked that he must have drunk litres of it every day. Many who talked about him said he was ""intelligent"", ""sociable"" and ""handsome"".Berk's brother Dogukan said he was trapped beneath rubble at the foot of the building with his mother after the earthquake, but was rescued in the immediate aftermath. He was critical of the official rescue effort, and said he had waited under the rubble for nine hours.He said he did not want to talk about the experience more while his brother was still missing, but neighbours said he had been rescued after managing to call his other brother, who was not at home at the time of the earthquake, for help. Berk has not been seen in days and his mother is now in hospital with injuries, apparently telling doctors: ""I cannot feel my feet and my son is trapped inside"".On the second floor lived another mother and daughter - 64-year-old Hatice and 33-year-old Derya.One family member described the pair as being like Tom and Jerry.""Whatever one did, the other did the opposite. But they couldn't live without each other,"" the relative said. ""They are probably inches apart even now.""Mevlut - Derya's father and Hatice's ex-husband - has waited each day for news of the pair.He described his daughter as being ""beautiful"" and ""full of life"", cupping his hands around his face for emphasis.In Derya's job, he said, she was responsible for ensuring safe environments in the workplace.That meant she would know ""where to go, what to do, how to act"" in an emergency.He was staying positive and was full of faith in his daughter's capabilities, holding out hope that she would ""lead her mother and others to a safe place in the building"".Living with Ceyda on the third floor was her mother and father. Her older sister had moved away from home but was still nearby. Neighbours gathered told us that when her sister arrived at Orcan after the earthquake, she fainted and had to be carried away.Her grandparents also lived around the corner. Their building, too, was destroyed by the earthquake.Relatives describe them as a close family and the parents as the perfect couple.Ceyda's dad, Cengiz, owned a spare parts shop. Her mum had lost two of her sisters earlier in life, and family members say they worry how she will cope if she is pulled from the wreckage to learn that her parents are also now dead.Ceyda's popularity in the community is evident within minutes of arriving on the street. Friends faces light up when they recall memories of her, while both her current and ex-boyfriend join the search for her.She was described as outgoing and thoughtful, and had been working hard to get into a university in Istanbul this year to study with Damla.""Her favourite thing is going for coffee,"" Damla says, adding that Ceyda would often take her friends out in her white Volkswagen car.The car is now parked metres from the ruined apartment building, its windshield crushed. A red lighter can be seen inside.On Friday, rescue workers called in through Ceyda's window: ""Is anyone alive there?"" before heavy machinery broke into the room, pushing those butterfly curtains into the debris.Damla says she is still determined that Ceyda will be found safe and ""will smile again"".While we stayed near the building, learning about its residents from friends and family, one survivor was pulled out.It was Ferdane, a single mother in her 50s who is well-liked in the community. She lived on the fourth floor.She was the survivor who said she had spoken to Ceyda.Rescue workers said she was injured and distressed and had been taken to hospital, where her adult son was at her bedside.When she was being taken away, she had asked how long she had been under rubble for, one worker said. Her son replied: ""Three days mama."" She thought it had been six. By Friday, though, rescue workers had told the families still waiting at the site that they should not expect any more survivors. If there were, it would be a miracle, they said.UPDATE, Saturday 11 February, 03:20 local time (00:20 GMT): Ceyda's body was found shortly after this article was published, along with the bodies of her father and mother. Her family buried them immediately in Iskenderun.Additional reporting by Emrah Bulut,  Nihan Kalle and Tural Ahmedzade.

8,Eurovision 2023: Fans mark Super Saturday with seven songs selected,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64553731,"If you're a sports fan, imagine having to choose between watching the FA Cup final, a Wimbledon singles final, or the final Test match in The Ashes. In Eurovision world that's sort of what fans are having to contend with, on what's been dubbed Super Saturday, as seven countries air huge TV programmes to pick a representative for the song contest in May.While there are 13 weeks until the song contest's grand final, 20-year-old Ethan Wilshaw from Plymouth will be sitting down with his parents to spin through performances from Italy, Estonia, Denmark, Malta, Latvia, Croatia and Romania.""It's quite stressful but I think that sort of chaos and overwhelming nature is inherent to Eurovision,"" he tells BBC News. ""I don't know how I'm going to prioritise them but the good thing is the different time zones because you can dip in and out.""He first watched the national final season in 2019 and one of his favourite things he's learnt is ""how important it is for other countries"" with these finals being the biggest night on TV in parts of Europe.There are typically two ways a Eurovision entry is chosen: an internal selection - an act chosen behind-the scenes - or a national selection - a TV show with the winner getting to fly their country's flag in Liverpool.In its 73rd year, Italy's five-night iconic Festival di Sanremo, which has become essential streaming for Eurovision fans, will see a winner chosen from the 28 competing acts. There are also special guests like Black Eyed Peas, Depeche Mode and Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello.I watched the second night on Wednesday with Italian friends who helped me with translation, told me the back story of contestants, and didn't kick me out for bringing a Hawaiian pizza (grazie).The show really is a unique event and, after pizza (and tiramisu), I still couldn't think of a comparable cultural show that unites a nation the way Sanremo does - but I ended up with a cross between the Royal Variety performance, the Super Bowl halftime show and the New Year's Eve countdown.The country's president, Sergio Mattarella, attended the opening night while other politicians and celebrities filled the seats for the rest of the week in black tie, with a huge chunk of the population watching at home, peaking at more than 16 million and a 62% share of TV viewers.M√•neskin, who've just released a new album and were nominated for best new act at last week's Grammy Awards, still describe winning the festival as ""one of the top three achievements"" in their career.Speaking to BBC News, frontman Damiano David says: ""Eurovision somehow makes sense that we won because we had cool outfits, had a powerful song and were very different from all the other contestants. It makes sense in my mind.""To win the most classical and traditional competition in Italian music... it's not what we do, it's not rock and roll music - it's soft pop or very deep song writing. It is still one of the most astonishing things that ever happened and I can't explain it.""The winner this year is tipped to be Marco Mengoni, who represented Italy at Eurovision in 2013, but he's adamant he ""just wants go on stage and feel like I'm on tour"". ""It's a cultural event and this year the cast is amazing,"" he explains on the BBC's Eurovisioncast podcast. ""Sanremo is a reflection of Italian music, all the rainbow colours of music are represented on stage."" Italy by far has the biggest national final on Saturday, but Estonia's Eesti Laul and Denmark's Melodi Grand Prix also command big domestic audiences, as well as fans abroad streaming them.The conversation dominates the fandom on Twitter and in WhatsApp group chats, which can be ""a chaotic mess"" for fans who live and breathe Eurovision all year.""I will try to watch as many as I can,"" explains 22-year-old Mandy Huibregtsen from Rotterdam, The Netherlands. ""Estonia has a super strong selection this year. My brother's girlfriend is Maltese, so she's been keeping me up to date with that. In national finals in other countries they give smaller artists a platform.""Italy's 28 acts is dwarfed by Denmark's eight artists in Dansk Melodi Grand Prix taking place in N√¶stved arena, about an hour outside of Copenhagen. Last year's Eurovision winners Kalush Orchestra will be the interval act.""I wanted to have a deeper connection to my home territory"", Reiley, who lives on the Faroe Islands, a self-governing nation under the external sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark, tells the BBC just before rehearsals.""I've done music in a bunch of different places but never in Denmark. I just love performing and any opportunity to put on an amazing show for people.""Most of his fans are in South Korea, after a previous song went viral there, but he says ""it's awesome"" fans outside of Denmark will be watching him compete on Saturday night. This video can not be playedThe rundown on the 2023 contest in 50 secondsThis year the BBC is using an internal selection for the United Kingdom, working with the same management company who approached Sam Ryder last year.A Eurovisioncast listener called Ben asked as these shows across Europe are so big now, if I thought the BBC would revisit that format in the future? The success of Sam Ryder - chosen internally - and the pressure for the UK to continue its success makes me think it would be a risk but Ethan in Plymouth disagrees.""I've actually managed to get my Mum and Dad to watch them with me and we get a takeaway,"" he laughs. ""I do think as we've found our mojo we would benefit from one.""We've got the public interest for it now and I think the UK would be engaged with one"".

9,Brit Awards 2023: Harry Styles steals the show with four wins,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64612218,"This video can not be playedHarry Styles thanks his former One Direction bandmatesHarry Styles has won all four Brit Awards he was nominated for, including best album, artist and pop/R&B act.The show opened with his huge hit As It Was, which won song of the year.""I'm aware of my privilege up here tonight,"" he said, naming women who missed out on artist of the year, including Mabel, Florence Welch, Charli XCX, Rina Sawayama and Becky Hill.Beyonce won international awards for best artist and song of the year, while Wet Leg won best group and new artist.Wet Leg's singer, Rhian Teasdale, said: ""This is so scary because being on the telly can be such a boys' club thing"" and thanked all the women who worked on their debut album, saying: ""I want to shout them out."" She also referenced Alex Turner's Arctic Monkeys Brits acceptance speech from 2014, saying: ""That rock and roll - it just won't go away. It might hibernate from time to time and sink back into the swamp."" Both bands share the same record label, Domino.This year's nominations saw no women up for best artist, following last year's decision by organisers to scrap their best male and best female awards in favour of gender-neutral prizes.Women who were eligible but missed out included those named by Styles in his speech.Flo, the only black British winner, won the rising star award, but did not get to perform on the night as has been the case in previous years - instead having their prize announced before the show.Styles also thanked his Mum for ""signing me up for X Factor without telling me"", along with his fellow One Direction members Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik. Shania Twain, who performed on stage at Coachella last year with Styles, gave him his Brit for song of the year.Earlier, she told the BBC's Mark Savage that the singer's popularity stems from him being ""incredibly authentic, and people sense that"".""He's nice, he's likeable, he's kind, he's a gentleman,"" she said. ""Obviously he's super-talented - he has everything you want as a fan to follow and appreciate and respect.""This is Harry's House and we're all just living in it.But while his success might seem preordained, it's easy to forget that reality show contestants and former boyband members are usually consigned to the great pop dumper, never to be seen again.When Harry Styles first went solo, his music was eclipsed by his bandmates - Zayn Malik and Liam Payne, in particular, scored hits that were bigger and stickier in those early, post-One Direction days.He started to find his way on his second album, Fine Line, delving into the 70s rock sounds of his childhood: Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Paul McCartney. He added some utopian philosophy of his own (Treat People With Kindness) and scored his first million-seller with the joyous and infectious Watermelon Sugar.His third album updates that sound, adding 80s synths, and an easy-going intimacy. The scat singing and synth horns on Music For A Sushi Restaurant capture his quirky charisma; while Boyfriends' critique of toxic masculinity is the song every girl wants Harry to sing to them while he paints their toenails.Unusually for a big pop album, Styles' voice is mellow and restrained instead of belting out the hooks, Adele-style. That makes it less immediate than you might expect - but it grows beautifully, like dough in a proving oven.It ended the year as the UK's best-selling album, shifting almost half-a-million copies. With numbers like that, the commercially-minded Brit Awards were never going to turn their back on Styles.Beyonce sent video messages for her wins as she was unable to attend, saying: ""Thank you so much for loving Break my Soul - the only intention for this song was to dance.""The singer, who made history at last week's Grammys where she won her 32nd award, thanked her fans and referenced her recent album and upcoming tour, saying: ""The renaissance begins.""Styles also won three awards at the Grammys, including album of the year.

Gilligan joked afterwards: ""I have to apologise, it just goes to show how strong the drinks are."" At another point, the presenter said ""technical difficulties"" meant they had to play a recording of Adele singing I Drink Wine at last year's ceremony.Live performers this year included Lizzo, Cat Burns, Stormzy, Sam Smith, Ella Henderson and Becky Hill.Rapper Aitch won best hip-hop/rap/grime artist, and said: ""Not to get all cliched, but not many people where I'm from, especially my side of Manchester, get the opportunity to stand up here and receive such an amazing gift or award.""He added that he performs ""to set examples and to make people know it's possible no matter where you're from"", adding ""Respect. 0161 in the building,"" a reference to Manchester's dialling code. Becky Hill won best dance act for the second year in a row, after performing her first US tour last year, and said it was ""such an honour"" to be nominated alongside stars including ""amazing Eliza Rose and the incredible Raye"".""I think Beyonce said it best in her Grammy speech. We all have the queer community to thank for the best genre on earth,"" she added. The 1975 won best alternative rock act - their fourth Brit Award - and lead singer Matty Healy said: ""This is one that has been voted for by the fans so that means a lot.""Best international group went to Irish rockers Fontaines DC, whose guitarist Carlos O'Connell said: ""My heart is full... I'm happy to be [here] to celebrate that.""Producer and French DJ David Guetta had already been announced as producer of the year, but he was presented with his award by Norman Cook, also know as Fatboy Slim.

10,'You are a miracle': Rescues continue in Turkey almost 150 hours after quake,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64617245,"Rescuers have pulled a seven-month-old baby from the rubble of a building in Hatay, southern Turkey, 139 hours after Monday's deadly earthquake.Elsewhere in Hatay, a 12-year-old girl, Cudie, was saved after being trapped for 147 hours.State media also reported a 13-year-old saved in Gaziantep on Sunday, with rescuers saying: ""You are a miracle.""The number of people confirmed to have died in Turkey and Syria has risen to more than 33,000. Syria has not reported an updated death toll since Friday, so the true number is likely higher.Hopes are dwindling of finding many more survivors, and on the ground there is a sense that the rescue mission will soon end. The Syrian Civil Defence Force, or White Helmets, which operates in in rebel-held areas of the country, has told the BBC that the group's search efforts are winding down.But tens of thousands of rescuers continued their search overnight across affected areas in Turkey and Syria.The seven-month-old baby, Hamza, was saved on Saturday, and footage from local authorities showed rescuers cheering and hugging one another.Separate video from the Turkish health ministry showed a small girl in a neck brace looking around as she was carried on a stretcher in the same province later on Sunday morning. And footage showed a father and daughter being pulled from a building in Hatay. ""He wants two cups of good tea,"" one of the rescuers said.But as the rescue operations wind down, the focus turns to recovery - and of reckoning with the situation. Thousands of buildings collapsed during the earthquake, raising questions about whether the natural disaster's impact was made worse by human failings.Turkey's President Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but, during one visit to a disaster zone earlier in the week, appeared to blame fate. ""Such things have always happened,"" he said. ""It's part of destiny's plan.""Officials say they have issued 113 arrest warrants in connection with the construction of buildings that collapsed, with 12 people taken into custody, including contractors. Rescuers in Syria have criticised the international response to the disaster, with the UN's relief chief Martin Griffiths saying the world has ""failed the people in north-west Syria"". ""They rightly feel abandoned. Looking for international help that hasn't arrived,"" he said.Ismail al Abdullah, of the White Helmets, told the BBC's Quentin Sommerville that the international community has ""blood on its hands"".This video can not be playedWatch: Turkey quake rescue effort saves mans life after five days under rubbleTurkey earthquake fault lines mapped from spaceTurkey arrests contractors on collapsed buildings15 apartments, three survivors - a lost community's stories"
11,The US murder trial obsessing true crime tourists,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64564568,"Each morning, at around 6am, the crowd starts to gather, a loose line forming outside the Colleton County Courthouse for the murder trial of Alex Murdaugh.Mr Murdaugh, scion of a legal dynasty, has pleaded not guilty in the fatal shootings of his wife and son. The trial in Walterboro, South Carolina - which has ended its third week - is just one piece of his stunning downfall, which features accusations of corruption and a faked assassination. The case has captivated the state. ""It's the only thing happening in Walterboro - the only thing that's ever happened in Walterboro,"" said Cassie Headden, as she waited in line on Friday morning. Spectators say they were fascinated by both the alleged crimes and the dramatic downfall of a storied southern family. From 1920 to 2006, three generations of Murdaughs served consecutively as chief prosecutors for the area, while their private family litigation firm earned them a small fortune.  ""They ruled this area for years and years, and now that's starting to crumble - at least it looks like it,"" said Wally Pregnall, who travelled from Charleston to watch the trial. Others have come in from across the country - California, Idaho, Wisconsin and Maine - turning this small city in the southern part of the state into a true-crime tourist destination. One group of friends carpooled an hour's drive from Hilton Head Island to watch together; another family drove two hours from Aiken, South Carolina, and took the day off work. Earlier this week, a local middle school teacher brought her class of teenagers in as a field trip.  ""I feel like it's being a part of history and we just wanted to be here to witness it,"" said Monica Petersen outside the court on Friday. The regulars carried snacks and water in clear plastic purses - the only type of bag allowed in court - and packed coats and scarves to stay warm inside the heavily air conditioned courtroom. Some brought notebooks, scribbling along to the proceedings, after willingly giving up their mobile phones, which are banned for spectators. ""We've joked that if John Grisham wrote this novel that people would have said he's lost it, because it's too unbelievable,"" said Walt Flowers, also from Charleston. Over three weeks, Creighton Waters, the lead prosecutor, has called dozens of witnesses and pulled from a mountain of evidence in an attempt to prove that Mr Murdaugh fatally shot his wife Maggie, 52, and son Paul, 22, at the dog kennels on the family's 1,700 acre hunting estate, Moselle.Mr Murdaugh, prosecutors allege, was stealing from his family firm - millions of dollars over a decade. The murders, they argued, were a desperate attempt to earn sympathy and prevent his financial crimes from coming to light. His lawyer, state Senator Dick Harpootlian, has rejected this theory in court, arguing his client - a loving family man - could not have murdered his family. ""He didn't kill - butcher - his son and wife,"" Mr Harpootlian said in court. ""And you need to put from your mind any suggestion that he did.""Next week, prosecutors are expected to call Curtis Eddie Smith - known as Cousin Eddie - who is alleged to have tried to shoot Mr Murdaugh on a rural road just three months after his wife and son were killed. Mr Murdaugh has admitted he organised the botched hit on himself so that his surviving son could collect $10m (¬£8.4m) in life insurance payments.¬†But Mr Smith said he never agreed to the hit, and the gun went off by mistake: ""If I shot him, he'd be dead.""Mr Murdaugh also faces separate charges for insurance fraud, theft, lying to the police and other crimes. He has yet to enter a plea in those cases. In court, friends and former colleagues testified that Mr Murdaugh confessed and apologised for stealing. His lawyer has told media the stolen money was used to feed an opioid addiction.The proceedings have been tedious at times, with hours of repetitive testimony regarding minute details of Mr Murdaugh's alleged financial misdeeds. But other witnesses have provided an intimate look at the Murdaugh family's private life, revealing details of the final moments of Maggie and Paul's life. Testifying on Friday, Blanca Turrubiate-Simpson, who worked as a housekeeper for the Murdaughs, testified that Maggie had texted her the evening she died from the family's beach home on Edisto Island. Maggie wanted to stay the night at Edisto, Ms Turrbiate-Simpson said, but Mr Murdaugh had asked her to come back to Moselle. ""She sounded like she didn't want to come home,"" Ms Turrubiate-Simpson said of Maggie. ""She liked being at Edisto."" And mobile phone evidence from that same night - a Snapchat video filmed by Paul and sent to a friend - placed Mr Murdaugh with his family minutes before prosecutors say they were killed. Mr Murdaugh had previously said he had not been at the dog kennels that night at all. The prosecution is expected to rest next week, giving the defence a chance to mount its case. Mr Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted. US lawyer charged with murder of wife and sonLawyer in failed 'hit man suicide' plot indicted"
12,Ukraine war: Russian soldier death rate highest since first week of war,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64616099,"Russian soldiers are dying in greater numbers in Ukraine this month than at any time since the first week of the invasion, according to Ukrainian data.The Ukrainian data shows 824 Russian soldiers dying per day in February. The figures were highlighted by the UK's Ministry of Defence. The figures cannot be verified - but the UK says the trends are ""likely accurate"".The increase comes as Ukrainian officials say that Russia has launched a ""big offensive"".However, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine (NSDC), Oleksiy Danilov, also said Russia is experiencing ""big problems"" with the campaign. ""Our troops are repulsing [the offensive] very strongly,"" Mr Danilov said. ""The offensive they planned is already taking place, gradually, but it's not the offensive they imagined.""Last week, Ukraine's outgoing defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said they were anticipating a new Russian offensive around 24 February - the anniversary of the full-scale invasion. Some of the fiercest fighting has been around Bakhmut in the east of the country.On Sunday, the head of Russia's Wagner mercenary force said the group had seized a settlement near the devastated city.Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Telegram: ""Today, the settlement of Krasna Hora was taken by assault detachments of the Wagner PMC."" Mr Prigozhin also gave his group credit for the offensive on Bakhmut, downplaying the Russian army's role: ""Within a radius of 50 km, plus or minus, there are only Wagner PMC fighters,"" he wrote. The statement hints at longstanding tensions between the Russian military and Wagner. When the town of Soledar was taken in January, Mr Prigozhin claimed his fighters were in full control there and boasted that only his troops took part - a claim the Russian defence ministry questioned.Bakhmut's strategic importance has been questioned, but the prolonged fighting has turned it into a symbolic prize.According to the Ukrainian data, highlighted by the UK, 824 Russian losses a day is more than four times the rate reported in June and July, when around 172 Russian soldiers died each day. The Ukrainian military claims 137,780 Russian military deaths since the full-scale invasion began.The UK's MoD pointed out the recent increase could be due to ""a range of factors, including lack of trained personnel, coordination, and resources across the front"". Ukraine ""also continues to suffer a high attrition rate"", the UK said.Russian forces have made little progress in Ukraine since their retreat from the major southern city of Kherson last November. Last month they captured the town of Soledar north of Bakhmut after an intense battle. Capturing Bakhmut could enable Russian forces to press on towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to Western countries to hurry sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine to help Ukraine repel Russia's expected offensive. The US agreed last week to send long-range missiles that would enable Ukraine to double its attack range.But President Zelensky wants the West to send fighter jets - saying during a visit to the UK Parliament this week that he was ""thanking you all in advance for powerful English planes"".Ukraine braced for new Russian offensive this monthRussians seen reinforcing east ahead of offensiveBorrowed time for Bakhmut as Russians close in"
13,Islamic State blamed for Syria attack killing 11,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64618184,"At least 11 people have died in an attack in central Syria that has been blamed on Islamic State militants, a war monitor has said.Militants attacked a group of about 75 people picking mushrooms near Palmyra, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said.Syria's state news agency SANA reported a lower death toll of four.The attack took place away from parts of northern Syria that were hit by Monday's deadly earthquake.The SOHR, which monitors developments in Syria through a network of sources, said that Islamic State cells have been exploiting the ""preoccupation of the international community"" following the aftermath of the quakes.It said that 10 civilians including a woman plus a member of the Syrian regime forces were killed, and others are missing.SANA reported that Islamic State members fired machine guns at the people on Saturday, and that ten were wounded in the attack, some ""critically"".Rescue groups have criticised the lack of aid reaching Syria in the aftermath of Monday's quake. Years of conflict have ravaged parts of the country that remain under the control of rebels, who are battling the government of President Bashar al-Assad. His government is under Western sanctions.Syria has been dealing with effects of a 12-year long civil war, which broke out in 2011 after pro-democracy demonstrations were met by deadly force from the government.The Syrian conflict has left half a million people dead, devastated cities, and drawn in other countries.In 2014, the jihadist group Islamic State seized large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, imposing its brutal rule on almost eight million people.The group was driven from its last piece of territory in 2019, but the UN has warned that it remains a persistent threat.The huge desert region in which Palmyra is located remains one of its main hideouts.IS has used hideouts to ambush Kurdish-led forces and Syrian government troops while continuing to carry out attacks in Iraq.The group has targeted many people, including women and children, in recent years who go hunting for truffle mushrooms in central, north-eastern and eastern Syria.In April 2021, the group carried out a similar attack, abducting 19 people, mostly civilians, in the eastern countryside of the central city of Hama. Syrian and Russian forces have continued to launch air strikes targeting IS desert hideouts.Quake death toll tops 28,000 as rescue hopes dwindleWhy has the Syrian war lasted 11 years?What is 'Islamic State'?"
14,UFC 284: Islam Makhachev beats Alexander Volkanovski to retain lightweight title,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/mixed-martial-arts/64614790,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Mixed Martial ArtsIslam Makhachev beat home favourite and featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski by unanimous decision to retain his lightweight title in an engaging contest at UFC 284 in Perth, Australia.In a close contest, Russian Makhachev's counter striking and offensive wrestling gave him the edge over a gallant Volkanovski. In victory, Makhachev 31, could replace Volkanovski, 34, who was attempting to become a double champion, as the UFC's pound-for-pound number one.The bout was billed by the UFC as the first ever meeting between their current pound-for-pound number one in Volkanovski, and the number two-ranked fighter in Makhachev.Volkanovski, who has dominated the featherweight division since winning the title in 2019, was stepping up to lightweight in the hope of following Conor McGregor, Amanda Nunes, Daniel Cormier and Henry Cejudo in becoming the fifth simultaneous double UFC champion.Makhachev, meanwhile, was making the first defence of his title since beating Charles Oliveira at UFC 280 in October.The Russian was a big pre-fight favourite with bookmakers because of his bigger size, with pundits pointing to his high-level wrestling as being the difference, but the fight was much closer than some predicted.There was a party atmosphere as Volkanovski made his way to the octagon, voraciously cheered by the Australians inside the RAC Arena, while in contrast Makhachev sported a stern, focused look as he was booed during his walk-out.Makhachev was also fighting without his coach, mentor and former UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov in his corner, after the latter suggested in January he was stepping away from the sport.The fight begun with both athletes showing patience as Volkanovski feinted and switched stances, while Makhachev looked for openings. Just over midway through the round, Makhachev had his first significant moment as a punch stunned Volkanovski, illustrating the difference in power, before he landed a takedown and ended the round in a dominant position.  The key moment in the second round belonged to Volkanovski however, as following another takedown from Makhachev, he managed to achieve what many previous opponents have struggled to do and got back to his feet.Volkanovski's resilience spurred the Perth crowd on as they roared with every punching combination and leg kick he landed through the next few rounds.Makhachev continued to use his range to his advantage, countering Volkanovski with swift left hands and takedown attempts.Following a dominant fourth round on the ground for Makhachev, Volkanovski pushed forward in the fifth, perhaps knowing he needed to convincingly win the round to secure victory.After showing strong takedown defence, Volkanovski dropped Makhachev towards the end and finished the fight in a dominant position, pounding him on the canvas.As the bell rang, both fighters got up and raised their arms, confident of victory, with everyone at the side of the octagon on their feet applauding both fighters' displays.The result meant Makhachev ended Volkanovski's 12-fight UFC winning streak and extended his own to 12, which is now the current longest in the promotion.  ""I thought he was going to be easy on the ground but this guy proved he wasn't,"" said Makhachev.""I showed why I am number one. If you like it, I am the best fighter in the world right now, thank you.""Volkanovski meanwhile, paid tribute to his opponent.""I appreciate the support but let's have a round of applause for Islam. Obviously a lot of people are going to be happy with that because they didn't give me a chance but it was a fun fight,"" he said.""Obviously I'd like to say this message with a win but there's nothing wrong with challenging yourself. Challenge yourself like this it only makers you stronger.""You can see I can get the job done but I came up short tonight, congrats to Islam, great fighter.""In the co-main event, Mexico's Yair Rodriguez put on a fine performance as he beat American Josh Emmett for the interim featherweight title via a second-round triangle choke.Rodriguez, 30, mixed up his striking beautifully, landing an array of damaging kicks, punch combinations and elbows.Emmett's power shone when he struck the elusive Rodriguez, but he was second best throughout.When the fight went to the ground, Rodriguez showed another layer to his dangerous set of skills as he locked in a triangle choke to end the fight.Rodriguez's win will likely set up an undisputed title fight with Volkanovski, who has said he wants to stay active in both the lightweight and featherweight divisions."
15,Fariba Adelkhah: French-Iranian academic released from Iran jail,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64606149,"An Iranian-French academic has been released from jail in Teheran after spending more than three years in prison, France's foreign ministry says.Fariba Adelkhah was given a five-year jail term in 2020 for conspiring against national security and one year for propaganda, which she denied.Her university, SciencesPo in Paris, announced the news ""with happiness and relief"". Although, it is not yet clear when Ms Adelkhah will be released.Supporters of Ms Adelkhah have always vehemently denied the charges she has faced, saying that the academic been unjustly imprisoned.The researcher is a specialist in social anthropology and the political anthropology of post-revolutionary Iran, and has written a number of books, including Revolution under the Veil: Islamic Women of Iran.At the time of her arrest in June 2019 she was examining the movement of Shia clerics between Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, and had spent time in the holy city of Qom.France's foreign ministry said in a statement that it welcomed her release from Evin prison in Tehran, saying Ms Adelkhah had been ""unjustly detained"".""It is essential that Fariba Adelkhah can recover all of her freedoms, including that of returning to France if she wishes,"" the statement added.In a tweet SciencesPo said: ""It is with happiness and relief that we announce the release of our dear colleague Fariba Adelkhah, arbitrarily detained in Iran for more than three years.

16,Thousands of pregnant Russian women fly to Argentina,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-64610954,"More than 5,000 pregnant Russian women have entered Argentina in recent months, including 33 on a single flight on Thursday, officials say.The latest arrivals were all in the final weeks of pregnancy, according to the national migration agency.It is believed the women want to make sure their babies are born in Argentina to obtain Argentine citizenship. The number of arrivals has increased recently, which local media suggests is a result of the war in Ukraine. Of the 33 women who arrived in the Argentine capital on one flight on Thursday, three were detained because of ""problems with their documentation"", joining three more who arrived the previous day, migration agency head Florencia Carignano told La Nacion. The Russian women had initially claimed they were visiting Argentina as tourists, she said. ""In these cases it was detected that they did not come here to engage in tourism activities. They acknowledged it themselves.""She said the Russian women wanted their children to have Argentine citizenship because it gave more freedom than a Russian passport. ""The problem is that they come to Argentina, sign up their children as Argentinean and leave. Our passport is very secure across the world. It allows [passport-holders] to enter 171 countries visa-free,"" Ms Carignano said.Having an Argentine child also speeds up the citizenship process for parents. As it stands, Russians can travel visa-free to only 87 countries. Travel to many Western countries has become more difficult for Russians since their country invaded Ukraine last February. Last September, the visa facilitation agreement between the EU and Russia was suspended, resulting in the need for additional documentation, increased processing times and more restrictive rules for the issuing of visas.A number of countries have also suspended tourist visas for Russians, including all EU member states that border Russia.A lawyer for the three women who were detained on Thursday said that they are being ""falsely imprisoned"", as they are being held on suspicion of being ""false tourists"". This is a term ""which does not exist in our legislation,"" Christian Rubilar said. ""These women who didn't commit a crime, who didn't break any migratory law, are being illegally deprived of their freedom,"" he added.The women have since been released. La Nacion attributed the dramatic uptick in arrivals of Russian citizens to the war in Ukraine, saying that ""besides fleeing war and their country's health service, [Russian women] are attracted by their [right of] visa-free entry to Argentina, as well as by the high-quality medicine and variety of hospitals"".""Birth tourism"" by Russian citizens to Argentina appears to be a lucrative and well-established practice. A Russian-language website seen by the BBC offers various packages for expecting mothers who wish to give birth in Argentina. The website advertises services such as personalised birth plans, airport pick-ups, Spanish lessons and discounts on the cost of stays in ""the best hospitals in the Argentinian capital"". The packages range from ""economy class"", starting at $5,000 (¬£4,144), to ""first class"", starting at $15,000 (¬£12,433).The website says its founder has been facilitating birth tourism and offering migration support since 2015, and the company says it is ""100% Argentinian"".On Saturday, La Nacion reported that Argentine police had been carrying out raids as part of an investigation into a ""million-dollar business and illicit network"" that allegedly provided pregnant Russian women and their partners with fake documents issued in record time to allow them to settle in Argentina. Police said the gang charged up to $35,000 (¬£29,011) for the service.No arrests were made, but police were said to have seized laptops and tablets, as well as immigration papers and significant quantities of cash.Separated by the virus (and 8,000 miles) from their newborn"
17,Tech layoffs: Yahoo to slash 20% of its workforce,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64596061,"Yahoo plans to lay off more than 20% of its total 8,600 workforce as part of a major restructuring.The veteran tech company is reorganising its advertising unit, which will lose more than half of the department by the end of the year. Nearly 1,000 employees will be affected by the cuts by the end of the week.Yahoo is the latest tech firm to announce job losses as firms struggle with a downturn in demand, high inflation and rising interest rates.""These decisions are never easy, but we believe these changes will simplify and strengthen our advertising business for the long run, while enabling Yahoo to deliver better value to our customers and partners,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.Yahoo, which has been owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management since a $5bn buyout in 2021, added that the move would enable the company to narrow its focus and investment on its flagship ad business called DSP, or demand-side platform.The layoffs are part of a broader effort by the company to streamline operations in Yahoo's advertising unit.It comes as many advertisers have pared back their marketing budgets in response to record-high inflation rates and continued uncertainty about a recession.The re-focus signals an intention by the firm to stop competing directly against the likes of Google and Facebook's Meta for digital advertising dominance.The Yahoo spokesperson added: ""The new division will be called - simply - Yahoo Advertising. ""In redoubling our efforts on the DSP on an omni-channel basis, we will prioritise support for our top global customers and re-launch dedicated ad sales teams towards Yahoo's owned and operated properties - including Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports and more.""Layoffs in the US hit a more than two-year high in January, as the technology industry, once a reliable source of employment, cut jobs at the second-highest pace on record to brace for a possible recession, a report showed on Thursday.Companies including Google, Amazon and Meta are now grappling with how to balance cost-cutting measures with the need to remain competitive, as consumer and corporate spending shrink amid high inflation and rising interest rates, after the pandemic.

18,Inside Aleppo: BBC sees devastation after quake,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64597879,"Only devastation remains inside Aleppo, a Syrian city that was already dealing with the effects of a years-long civil war before the deadly earthquake hit on Monday. The BBC is one of the first international outlets to report from the government-controlled city, where over 400 people have died.We travelled to the affected parts of the war-torn city on Friday with the Syrian government's permission.As we entered the damaged neighbourhoods, it was difficult to distinguish between the destruction caused by this country's 12-year long civil war, and the devastation caused by the earthquake.We saw residents waiting around in the cold squares surrounded by debris, many wrapped in blankets and coats. In the eastern neighbourhood of al-Shaar, the sound of diggers rang out against the backdrop of multi-storey buildings flattened to the ground. ""We know someone in that building who lived on the first floor... he didn't have enough time to get out of his house,"" one woman told us, gesturing towards a pile of rubble.""The building collapsed while he was still in there. He died alongside his wife and children,"" she said.Only one of his daughters was saved from under the rubble and is in the hospital now.The quake has brought more misery to a country already gripped by crisis. The death toll across government and rebel-held areas has reached nearly 4,000, with more than 7,000 people reported injured or unaccounted for. Much of Aleppo was destroyed in the civil war, which broke out in 2011 when a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned violent.Despite efforts to rebuild some parts of the former cosmopolitan hub, the city still bears the wounds of the war between the Russian-backed Syrian government and rebel groups.Now, rescue teams have to pull down even some of the buildings still standing, out of fear they might collapse later on. ""Two buildings near me came down; they each contained around 30 flats, and at least five people were living in each flat,"" on man told us.""There are around 60 or 70 people still trapped under the rubble; only four or five people got out,"" he said.Rescue efforts have been hampered by the instability of the buildings left standing. ""As you can see the buildings are shaking while we work to save people. We can't have that under international health and safety guidelines. So we've evacuated the residents"" an army officer told us.  ""There are a large numbers of people in shelters. Most of them are people who were evacuated because their buildings are not safe,"" he continued. Thousands of residents from the worst-hit eastern districts of Aleppo have been forced into shelters. After years of war and now a hugely destructive earthquake, what comes next for them is unknown. Additional reporting by Merlyn ThomasHow do rescue teams reach people under rubble?"
19,Viktoria Nasyrova: Woman guilty of lookalike cheesecake poisoning plot,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64595317,"A Russian woman living in New York city has been found guilty of attempting to murder her doppelg√§nger in a bizarre identity-theft plot.Viktoria Nasyrova tried to kill her beautician Olga Tsvyk in 2016 by giving her a piece of cheesecake poisoned with a strong sedative.However Ms Tsvyk survived, and when she returned from hospital, found her identity documents had been stolen.Nasyrova will be sentenced next month, and is facing up to 25 years in prison.At the time, the pair looked quite similar, with dark hair and the same skin complexion, and they were both Russian speakers.""The jury saw through the deception and schemes of the defendant,"" Melinda Katz, the Queens District Attorney said in a statement.""Fortunately, her victim survived and the poison led right back to the culprit,"" Ms Katz added.The jury heard that in August 2016, Nasyrova, now 47, went to her beautician's house in Queens with a box of cheesecake - eating two pieces herself, and offering the third, poisoned slice to Ms Tsvyk, who was 35 at the time. She started to vomit and went to lie down.This video can not be playedWatch: Prosecutor describes the pain inflicted by the poisoning""Before passing out, the woman's last memory was of seeing the defendant walking around her room,"" Ms Katz's statement said.Ms Tsvyk's friend found her unconscious the next day, her clothes changed to lacey lingerie and pills scattered around the floor as if she had tried to take her own life.When she finally returned home, Ms Tsvyk's Ukrainian passport and US work permit were missing, as well as jewellery and about $4,000 (¬£3,300) in cash, the prosecutor said during opening statements.Phenazepam, a strong sedative, was detected in remnants of the cheesecake, and the pills scattered on the floor were also confirmed to be the same drug.Nasyrova, who lives in Brooklyn, was convicted on Thursday of attempted murder, assault and unlawful imprisonment.This is not the first time she has been in trouble with the law.In 2015, Interpol issued a red notice for her arrest over the murder of a woman in Russia a year earlier. She is accused of killing her neighbour Alla Alekseenko and stealing her life savings.Nasyrova, who US media reports is a former dominatrix, has also been accused of drugging and robbing men she met on dating websites.Her crimes - both alleged and convicted - were the subject of a documentary by CBS's investigative programme 48 Hours in 2017.Russian spy: What happened in the Salisbury poisoning?Two guilty of businesswoman murder in ¬£4.6m fraud"

The allegations are ""wicked"" and ""malicious"", the army statement said.The race to become the next president of Africa's most populous country is too close to call. The three top contenders in the 25 February elections are: Bola Tinubu from the governing All Progressives Congress, Atiku Abubakar from the Peoples Democratic Party and Peter Obi from the Labour Party.The army said that it was professional and ""loyal to the constitution"" and would never be part of a plot to overthrow the civilian authorities.""The Armed Forces of Nigeria will never be part of any ignoble plot to truncate our hard-earned democracy,"" said the spokesperson for Nigeria's Defence Headquarters Brigadier General Tukur Gusau. The government and the main political parties have not responded to the army's statement.The military takeover claim has largely been ignored by the public - many people are focussed on more pressing worries such as insecurity, fuel scarcity and a shortage of new banknotes, which has added to the country's economic crisis.

21,The congressman plagued by a bizarre mix of scandals,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64587233,"Politicians from both parties lined up this week to make jokes at the expense of George Santos, the newly elected Republican Congressman plagued by an increasingly bizarre mix of scandals. Voters in his New York district are not amused.Michael Glickman, a 45-year-old independent voter from Long Island, did not mince his words when asked to deliver his verdict on Mr Santos.""The community has never been in the spotlight for the idiocy of people who represent us,"" Mr Glickman said. ""It's a national embarrassment.""The embarrassment began almost two months ago when a New York Times investigation into Mr Santos revealed that the narrative of his life provided to voters was largely made up.That included lies about his faith, college degrees, and work experience.Since then, there has been a flood of further allegations: the 34-year-old has been accused of sexual misconduct by a former member of his staff; of falsely claiming his mother perished in the attacks of 11 September 2001; of stealing money he fundraised for a dying dog; and of lying about his Jewish heritage. The list grows longer every few days.Mr Santos has admitted ""embellishing"" his biography, but denied other claims including the sexual misconduct and theft allegations. In some instances, he has failed to provide clear answers at all.   ""Here's the reality. I'm human and I've made mistakes,"" Mr Santos said in an interview with the right-wing Newsmax outlet this week. ""I've made peace with those mistakes, and I've come clean on those mistakes."" Not everyone is convinced by that - or ready to simply move on.At Tuesday's State of the Union in the House of Representatives, Mr Santos was confronted by his fellow Republican Mitt Romney. The US Senator reportedly called his colleague a ""sick puppy"" and told him he did not belong in Congress.That was a sentiment shared by more than a dozen voters - Republican, Democratic and Independent - who the BBC spoke to in New York's Third Congressional District at the end of another difficult week for a politician who was only sworn into office in January. Some called for his imprisonment, while many argued that he should resign or be expelled from the House of Representatives.""Whatever he says, whatever he does, is not trustworthy,"" said Johanna Hurwitz, who has lived in the Long Island village of Great Neck for 48 years. ""We cannot have liars running Congress,"" said Luann Pizzo of Bayside, a town in the New York borough of Queens. ""He does not belong in Congress. He does not belong in politics."" George Santos originally made a splash by delivering a political upset during November's midterm elections. A relative newcomer to US politics, he beat his Democratic opponent Robert Zimmerman with nearly 54% of the vote, flipping the district to Republican control. He now represents some 740,000 people in a district that covers north-eastern Queens and northern Long Island, just over an hour by train from Manhattan. It is the wealthiest district in New York state. There, he faces an investigation launched by Republican Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly as well as growing frustrations from constituents.""We don't even know his real name,"" said Louis Ann, who lives in the waterside neighbourhood of Bayside, referring to how Mr Santos previously introduced himself publicly as Anthony Devolder. ""He said his mother was in the World Trade Center when it came down,"" said Bayside resident Maureen Hahn. ""She wasn't even in the country. Everything out of his mouth is a lie.""Amid the mounting scandals, the Republican congressman said last week that he would step down from two House committee assignments to stop being a ""distraction"" until his name was cleared. That wasn't enough for some of Mr Santos's constituents, including dozens who travelled to Washington, DC, to protest outside his office and call on him to resign. His colleagues in the nation's capital took aim at him as well, including Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace who delivered a string of one-liners at his expense at a glitzy dinner with reporters on Thursday night.  ""I know George Santos hoped to deliver tonight's keynote,"" she said. ""But organisers wanted someone who could tell a joke, but not actually be one"". Fellow New Yorker and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer piled on. ""I'm not just Jew-ish,"" Mr Schumer said, in a reference to Mr Santos back-pedalling on previous claims that he had Jewish heritage. ""I'm the real thing, baby!"" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, however, has so far resisted calls to do more to punish Mr Santos - and the congressman himself insists he has no intention of resigning. That frustrates some of his constituents. ""The democracy we have nowadays is not like years ago, where when you did something wrong, you were out,"" said Ms Pizzo in Queens. But not everyone here wants him out. Mary McGovern, a 55-year-old Queens resident, voted for Mr Santos after switching from the Democratic Party to vote for former President Donald Trump. She said political scandals happened on both sides of the aisle - and she was less concerned about Mr Santos as an individual and more focused on supporting Republican values. ""I'd rather have 10 of him than one Democrat,"" she said.David Paxton, a Queens resident who works in Great Neck, said he felt differently. ""I'm a conservative man, and he gives conservatives a bad name."" Mr Paxton said people in Great Neck - a village on the North Shore of Long Island, home to around 11,000 people - had grown tired of the Democratic Party in recent years, and Mr Santos seized that opportunity.Mr Glickman, the independent voter, said Mr Santos was a ""no one"" in the Great Neck area before he emerged as a political candidate. ""He never ingratiated himself in Great Neck and never got to know the community,"" he said, adding that Mr Santos had now completely disappeared from the place he only recently relied on for donations and votes. But at the very least, Mr Glickman said, the district was now coalescing around their rejection of the congressman.""This community is never in lockstep on anything,"" he said. ""And yet, I have yet to find a person here who wants to see him stay in office.""Brazil revives fraud charges against George SantosCongressman quits committees amid lying scandalSantos denies taking money from dying dog GoFundMe"

23,Kanye West: Adidas warns of losses from Yeezy fallout,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64591805,"Adidas has warned of a potential major impact on its profits after ending its partnership with rapper and fashion designer Kanye West last November.The firm's new boss said it could lose hundreds of millions of dollars this year if it decides not to sell its stock of Yeezy sneakers.The sportswear giant cut ties with West, known as Ye, after he posted anti-Semitic comments on social media.The announcement marks the company's fourth profit warning since July.""The numbers speak for themselves. We are currently not performing the way we should,"" Adidas' chief executive Bj√∏rn Gulden, said in a statement.Adidas said it was still deciding whether to scrap its remaining Yeezy stock and would take a ‚Ç¨500m (¬£443m) hit to its profits if it is all written off.The company also expects a shake-up of the business to cost a further ‚Ç¨200m. That could mean Adidas is pushed into a ‚Ç¨700m operating loss this year. Although the company expects to return to profit in 2024.At the same time the company revealed that its profit for last year had fallen to ‚Ç¨669m.In October, the company announced that it was ending the highly profitable partnership with West after he caused an outcry over his anti-Semitic comments.While the decision to end its partnership with Yeezy had a major negative impact on Adidas, it has also faced other challenges over the last year.Mr Gulden joined Adidas at the start of this year from rival Puma after his predecessor was ousted in the wake of a series of profit warnings.In March, the company announced that it would close its shops in Russia and suspend its online store there as it joined a raft of global brands that pulled out of the country in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.The firm's business in China was also impacted by Beijing's strict zero Covid measures that saw major cities across the country put into lockdown.This video can not be played'Kanye West and Kendall Jenner wore my vintage T-shirts'Adidas investigates claims over 'toxic' Kanye WestAdidas cuts Kanye West ties over anti-SemitismJP Morgan Chase cuts ties with Kanye WestKanye West to end partnership with Gap"
24,Mike Pence summoned to testify in criminal probe of Trump,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64591939,"Former US Vice-President Mike Pence has been issued with a legal summons to testify in a criminal investigation of former President Donald Trump.The subpoena is reportedly linked to Mr Trump's bid to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election.Department of Justice Special Counsel Jack Smith is also investigating Mr Trump's handling of classified files.The subpoena piles pressure on Mr Pence as he considers a potential White House run against Mr Trump in 2024. Failure to comply with such a summons could lead to serious legal consequences. Sources told US media that the order was related to Mr Trump's efforts to quash the election result and the riot by his supporters at Capitol Hill on 6 January 2021.The special counsel is also leading a parallel inquiry into whether Mr Trump mishandled classified documents that were found in a search of his Florida home. Neither Mr Pence nor the Department of Justice confirmed that a subpoena had been issued.The move marks a milestone in the two-year investigation, which was taken over by the special counsel in November.Mr Trump publicly pressured his vice-president to attempt to block the transfer of power.His refusal led Mr Trump to lash out at him, and saw Trump supporters chant ""hang Mike Pence"" as they stormed Congress during the riot. The former vice-president is reportedly considering launching a White House bid in 2024. Mr Trump has already started his campaign.Mr Pence, a former Indiana governor, had previously resisted testifying to the Democratic-led House of Representatives committee investigating the Capitol riot. That panel has since disbanded. The latest move by the justice department could set up a fight over executive privilege - the legal doctrine that shields some presidential communications. It is unclear if investigators will also seek to question Mr Pence about confidential files. In January, aides to Mr Pence told US officials they had found classified documents at the former vice-president's home. The search was conducted after similar documents were discovered at President Joe Biden's home in Delaware and at an office he used in Washington. Another special counsel, Robert Hur, is investigating the Biden files.Marc Short, the former chief of staff to Mr Pence, told CNN on Wednesday that the FBI was expected to search the ex-vice-president's house for any additional documents ""not too far off into the future"".

25,Ukraine war: More blackouts after 'massive' Russian attack,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64593488,"Russia's latest aerial attack on Ukraine saw missiles cross Moldovan airspace, Ukrainian and Moldovan officials have said.Kyiv's top general said missiles also flew above Romania - a claim denied by Romania, but later repeated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Mr Zelensky said the missiles represented a ""challenge"" to Nato, of which Romania is a member country.A Russian government spokesperson deflected questions about the incident. During a regular call with journalists, Dmitry Peskov told the BBC it was a matter for the defence ministry, which is yet to comment.Moldova's country's defence ministry described the missile flyover as a ""violation"", and summoned the Russian ambassador for an explanation - having done the same following a similar incident in October.The incident occurred on a day of political turbulence in Chisinau, during which the whole government resigned.For its part, Romania insisted that Russian missiles had not strayed into its airspace ""at any time"".But Mr Zelensky doubled down on the Ukrainian military's Romanian claim, writing that the Russian missiles posed questions for ""collective security"". In a post on the Telegram messaging app, he added there were ""victims"" of the assault, without specifying a number.The Ukrainian air force said 71 missiles were fired in Friday's ""massive"" attack, of which it shot down 61.In the aftermath, an aide of Mr Zelensky reiterated a call for the West to donate fighter jets, and criticised ""political hesitation"" over the provision of new arms to his country.Mr Zelensky himself had spent the previous day meeting EU leaders and appealing for planes to be sent - following another visit to the UK for the same purpose.Ukraine is suffering blackouts after energy facilities were targeted in six regions.Some 150,000 homes were without electricity in the eastern Kharkiv region alone, and seven people were injured, officials said. Explosions were also heard in Kyiv, although the city's mayor said nobody was hurt. Residents sheltered in the capital's metro system, and school lessons were reportedly held in one station.Other regions, including Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, also came under fire, and the governor of Mykolaiv region described at least three ""waves"" of missiles.Moscow has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy facilities over the winter, and Ukraine's state energy firm described Friday's assault as the fourteenth of its kind. Such attacks have been described by some analysts as war crimes, although Russia denies intentionally harming civilians. Energy workers in the country have increasingly dangerous jobs - and 98 of them lost their lives while performing their duties last year, an official recently told Latvian media.

26,Assam: India child brides desperate after mass arrests,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64564861,"Momina Khatun is convinced she is cursed.She's one of hundreds of women in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam who married under the age of 18 - and are now stuck in limbo after their husbands were arrested in a crackdown on child marriage. The state government claims it wants to eradicate the illegal practice, but Ms Khatun and other women whose husbands are in custody say they have been left helpless.Ms Khatun, who is expecting a baby, didn't have an easy start in life, but marriage turned out better than she expected. Her father remarried when she was eight. A few months later her mother abandoned her too, leaving her to live with her paternal aunt in a tiny village in the state.""Life was difficult there. I was treated like I was a burden to her family,"" Ms Khatun said. Last year, when her aunt's family decided to get her married at the age of 17, she was delirious with fear. ""We were always told that the man we marry will determine the quality of our life. I was young and worried what would happen if my husband was a bad person."" But Yakub Ali, the farmer she married, turned out to be a kind man who took away the ""loneliness and replaced it with genuine love and affection"", Ms Khatun said.""There wasn't much, we were poor. At least there was peace.""But their happiness was short-lived. On 4 February, Mr Ali was arrested from their home and charged with marrying Ms Khatun when she was a minor.A week on, the 22-year-old remains in custody. Ms Khatun, who is seven months pregnant, has not been able to meet her husband since his arrest.""Where do I go? I have no one. My child and I will die hungry and lonely,"" she said.Ms Khatun and hundreds of other women in Assam have been protesting after their male relatives were arrested in connection with cases of child marriage. More than 8,100 people have been named in police complaints so far, including the parents of grooms and priests who performed the marriage ceremonies. It was not immediately clear how the police arrived at the figures - the BBC has contacted officials for comment - but at least 2,500 people have been arrested since last week.Women like Ms Khatun see the action as a ""cruel interference in their lives"". Mostly uneducated and poor, they say the arrested men are primary breadwinners for their families and that they depend on them to survive. Videos of women, wailing outside police stations and rolling on the ground, have cascaded over social media, fuelling feelings of anger and outrage. Those like Mr Ali, who are accused of marrying girls aged 14-18, are being charged under a law that bans child marriage and carries a sentence of two years and a fine. Men accused of marrying girls below 14 have been charged under a more stringent law that protects children from sexual offences, a non-bailable felony carrying jail terms ranging from seven years to life.Reports say that districts with higher Muslim populations in Assam have seen more arrests than others, though hundreds of Hindu men have also been arrested.Under Muslim personal law in India, girls can get married once they reach puberty. The conflict between this and India's Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, which bars all marriages of women below the age of 18, is being challenged in the Supreme Court.""There is a line of precedent that special laws will override general personal laws of any religion,"" according to Dr Arghya Sengupta, research director of Vidhi Legal, a think-thank.But he added that ""the unjustness of the situation"" also needs to be factored in. ""The personal law of Muslims has allowed girls who have attained puberty to marry of their own free will for decades. So to suddenly throw their husbands in jail for a practice which, in their eyes, was never wrong may be unjust.""Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma maintains that his government is at ""war"" against child marriage and isn't targeting any one community. But critics say the retrospective arrests are the latest attempt of the state's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to marginalise minorities, especially Bengali-speaking Muslims.The community, which migrated from what was once East Pakistan and is now Bangladesh, has long faced discrimination in the multi-ethnic state, where linguistic identity and citizenship are the biggest political fault lines.The Hindu-nationalist BJP government, which is also in power nationally, has announced a slew of policies, including a controversial citizenship law, that critics say discriminates particularly against Bengali-speaking Muslims.Experts say the arrests could push illegal marriages underground, making them harder to report. ""Child marriages are more a social malaise than a religious one, and are rooted in poverty and patriarchy,"" says Dr Abdul Azad, lecturer and researcher at Vrije University, Amsterdam. ""It is only through social and economic upliftment of communities that the practice can be truly eradicated - not by explicitly targeting a single community.""Although illegal, child marriage is widespread in many parts of India mainly due to patriarchal customs, lack of education and poverty.Very few cases are actually reported. In Assam, only 155 cases of child marriage were registered in 2021, and 138 in 2020, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. The latest crackdown started on 23 January, when Mr Sarma expressed alarm over the soaring underage pregnancy rate in Assam and promised to put an end to the problem.The sudden nature of the move has shattered many families. Khalidul Rashid, a resident of Dhubri district in Assam, breaks down before he even begins speaking.He says his 23-year-old daughter Kulsoom Khan took her own life on 4 February. The eldest of four, Kulsoom was married off when she was 14. In 2020, when her husband died of Covid-19, she moved back to her parent's home with her two children.Everything was fine in her life, her father says, but when she heard last week about the arrests, she became vey tense.On Friday, she asked her father for her marriage certificate. ""I told her that her husband was dead and she had nothing to worry about,"" Mr Rashid says.But Kulsoom was afraid the police would arrest her parents.""So she took her life - to protect us,"" Mr Rashid says.Dr Kalam says that while most of the child marriages in Assam occur among the marginalised communities, a powerful social movement against the practice has taken shape in recent years.Now the government's ""aggressive approach"", he says, will weaken this movement. ""Our society has become so divided that such brutal actions are gaining support,"" Dr Kalam says.Masud Zaman, a lawyer based in Dhubri district who is fighting on behalf of eight women protesters, agrees with the assessment. A Muslim-dominated area, Dhubri has recorded the highest number of arrests. ""The common perception is that child marriage is a problem of Muslim society. But child marriage rates are high in Dhubri because it's one of the poorest districts of Assam, where most families are illiterate. Not because Muslims live here,"" Mr Zaman says. He accused the government of turning a social issue into a communal one, at the expense of women's lives.While both Hindu and Muslim men have been rounded up in the recent arrests, the lawyer alleges there has been selective treatment in the way bail is being given. ""In Majuli - which is predominantly home to tribal communities - 24 men got bail within a day. We argued on behalf of [Muslim] men accused of the same offences on the same grounds, but couldn't get bail.""The BBC saw a copy of one of the bail orders passed by a district court in Majuli, which states the arrests had been made on ""vague and insufficient grounds"".Mr Zaman added that it was insensitive to think money - the government has announced financial compensation for the affected women - could alleviate their grief. ""What about the emotional bond between a wife and her husband? How will the government compensate women for that?""It's a question that haunts Ms Khatun.""Does suffering ever end in a woman's life?"" she says.India's Covid crisis sees rise in child marriageThe ambitious child brides of India"
27,President Biden says balloon was not a major security breach,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64585714,"US President Joe Biden has said he does not believe the suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over US airspace was a major security breach. Mr Biden told news programme Noticias Telemundo on Thursday that he does not regret how he handled the situation. The balloon was shot down over the Atlantic after it had travelled across the US.Some lawmakers have criticised the president for not destroying it sooner. ""It's not a major breach,"" Mr Biden said, adding that it was ""a violation of international law. It's our airspace. And once it comes into our space, we can do what we want with it"".He said the military was concerned that destroying the craft over land would have put people on the ground at risk.""They made a wise decision. They shot it down over water, they're recovering most of the parts, and they're good,"" he said. Speaking to the BBC, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said it would be difficult to say how the US might handle another situation like this one. ""I'm certainly not going to get into how the intelligence community or the Pentagon moves forward with this programme and how they assess,"" she said. On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution calling the balloon a ""brazen violation"" of US sovereignty, a move dismissed by China as ""purely political manipulation and hyping up"".""China is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters on Friday. The balloon first entered US airspace on 28 January over Alaska and was shot down last weekend off the coast of South Carolina, where its pieces are still being salvaged by the US Navy. China has denied the balloon was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray. This video can not be playedWatch: BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera explains the US/China rowThe US, however, said the balloon is part of a fleet of surveillance balloons that have flown over five continents.

28,Russia to cut oil production over price caps,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64594715,"Russia will reduce crude oil production by 500,000 barrels per day from March after major economies imposed a price cap on oil products. Oil prices rose after Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Novak announced the cut. The European Union, G7 nations and Australia have capped how much they will pay for oil and refined products.These are part of western sanctions designed to put pressure on Russia over its war in Ukraine.Russia is one of the largest oil producers in the world. Its planned cuts sent the price of Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, up by 2.2% to $86 per barrel.Western countries have been introducing tougher oil sanctions on Russia as its invasion of Ukraine continues, as part of efforts to limit the Kremlin's gain from sales and reduce its ability to finance the war.Most recently, an EU ban on seaborne imports from Russia of refined oil products, such as diesel, came into force this week. Traders who do not comply with these sanctions have access to tanker fleets and insurance markets restricted.In the case of the oil price cap, countries stopped the use of Western-supplied maritime insurance, finance and brokering for seaborne Russian oil priced above $60 per barrel from 5 December.In response, Russia has banned any deals involving the cap. Mr Novak said: ""As of today, we are fully selling the entire volume of oil produced, however, as stated earlier, we will not sell oil to those who directly or indirectly adhere to the principles of the 'price cap'.""In this regard, Russia will voluntarily reduce production by 500,000 barrels per day in March. This will contribute to the restoration of market relations.""So far, according to Mr Novak, Russia has been able to find buyers for all of its output, despite the sanctions.Industry sources told the BBC that hundreds of tankers have been acquired by companies in recent weeks, creating a so-called ""dark fleet"" prepared to carry Russian crude at higher prices. The last big fall in Russian oil output was in April last year, when it collapsed by nearly 9% following the introduction of Western sanctions over Ukraine.But since then, Russia has managed to set up logistics chains for its oil sales, mostly in Asia. Last year, Russian oil production rose by 2% to 10.7 million barrels per day.Petrol falls back below ¬£1.50 a litrePetrol prices dropping too slowly, says watchdogOil price cap will hit Putin immediately, says US"
29,Fighter jets for Ukraine: The challenges of giving warplanes to Kyiv,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64587197,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky spent much of the past week touring European capitals, appealing to leaders to send his country fighter jets.At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have around 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly consisting of aging Soviet-era MiG-29s and Su-27s. But officials say they need up to 200 jets to match Moscow's air-power - which is thought to be five or six times greater than Kyiv's. Mr Zelensky is primarily seeking US-made F-16s. First built in the 1970s, the jet can travel at twice the speed of sound and can engage targets in the air or on the ground. While now eclipsed by the more modern F-35, it remains widely in use. Experts say modern fighters like the F-16 would help Ukraine strike behind Russian lines.US President Joe Biden has ruled out supplying the jets for now. But countries like Poland and the Netherlands have signalled an openness to supplying Ukraine from their own fleet. However, Mr Zelensky's request poses a host of practical challenges, that could make an early delivery of such aircraft unlikely. Here's four of them:Ukraine is said to have identified 50 pilots who could begin training on Western jets immediately, but preparing them to fly the warplanes takes time and takes them away from the current fighting. The British government has agreed to start training Ukrainian pilots on Nato-standard aircraft, but warns that supplying the jets would only ever be a long-term option.Training pilots could take months or even years, given how complex the fighter jets are. But British officials have said they could speed up the training process for some of Ukraine's more seasoned pilots, who have years of experience flying Soviet-era planes. A fighter jet comes with an entire eco-system to support it. To function in a warzone, it needs complex and specialised engineering - it isn't ""a simple case of towing an aircraft to the border,"" in the words of the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. Former Nato official Dr Jamie Shea told the BBC that fourth-generation fighter jets - like the ones requested by Ukraine - require extensive maintenance after almost every flight. ""When I was at Nato and visited an airbase, planes would come back in and the engineers would have to strip out whole systems and put them back in. It's almost like every time you drive your car you have to put a whole carburettor in,"" Dr Shea said. ""So they've got a very high maintenance requirement.""German MP Tobias Bacherle is also concerned that handing over the jets would be a long-term commitment, explaining that the issue is ""not only about delivering"".""It's an ongoing engagement, this would be very different to delivering tanks, or delivering anti-aircraft missiles or other heavy weaponry as we've done before"", he told the BBC.Any jets handed over by Nato countries become Ukrainian property so that no Nato personnel are involved directly in the war. But that means Ukrainians must also be trained in maintaining the planes, adding more time to the process. There's been speculation that countries like the UK and France could hand over older generations of warplanes to Ukraine, which has ignited some debate over the types of jet that should be provided. The logistics of different countries sending a variety of old models would be ""forbidding"", the Economist's defence editor Shashank Joshi told the BBC.And not all of the newer models suit Ukraine's war needs. Recent generations of the UK's Typhoon jet aren't ""optimised for flying at low altitudes, which is what Ukraine has been forced to do because of the Russian air defence threat,"" Mr Joshi said. Justin Bronk from the Rusi think tank said giving Typhoons to Ukraine would be a ""very expensive symbolic gesture"". He observed that most of Ukraine's airbases were dispersed and hidden at the beginning of the war to avoid being targeted by Russian missiles. The move resulted in Ukraine's air force operating from ""relatively austere dispersed airbases"" and ""short-field"" runways with rough surfaces. UK MP Bob Seely, who served in the UK armed forces, said that Typhoon jets would struggle to operate under such conditions. ""You have to have a plane which is versatile and flexible and can be used when your enemy is bombing your runways and your hangers,"" Mr Seely told the BBC. ""It's got to be a practical offering, my worry is [the Typhoon] is not practical."" Ukraine would need a jet with greater versatility and landing flexibility, like the Swedish-made Gripen jet, he added.""A Gripen is a reasonably simple plane and very cheap by modern standards, it's good value, it's versatile...it's a useable plane and is useable by the Ukrainians in a relatively short time frame,"" Mr Seely said. ""It is designed for short take off and to cope with a short rough runway, it comes with kit in a box, almost like an Ikea plane."" Sweden has so far ruled out supplying Gripen jets to Ukraine. Some Nato member countries are worried that handing jets to Ukraine would be viewed as escalating the war, risking a direct confrontation with Russia.French President Emmanuel Macron said that if France did sent warplanes, he would not want any to be used to ""touch Russian soil"".The Kremlin has already made repeated accusations that Nato is an aggressor by proxy, warning on Thursday that the line between direct and indirect Western involvement in the conflict was disappearing.Dr Shea says a ""Rubicon has been crossed"" in terms of the more general delivery of weapons to Ukraine in the last few weeks.Countries ""serious about Ukraine winning"" need to weigh up the need to provide air cover to the tanks they have supplied to Ukraine, with the risk of escalating the war.""It doesn't make sense to give Ukraine four members of a five member basketball team and then deny that critical fifth member that makes all the difference,"" he told the BBC.Germany rules out sending fighter jets to UkraineNo immediate sending of jets to Ukraine - WallaceWest sends Ukraine mixed messages on war planesZelensky takes fighter jet bid to EU leaders"
30,Macron mulls stripping Putin of France's top honour,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64594769,"French President Emmanuel Macron has said he is considering stripping Vladimir Putin of France's top honour.The Russian leader was presented with the Legion d'Honneur in 2006 by former French President Jacques Chirac. The title is the highest French order of merit, both military and civil, and was established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte.But Mr Macron said he is waiting for the ""right moment"" to strip the Russian president of the title. He was speaking after awarding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the honour on Wednesday.Mr Macron said that the question of Mr Putin's medal was ""symbolic but important"".While the French president said he believed he had the right to revoke the honour, he added: ""It is not a decision that I made today."" Such decisions ""are always meaningful and I think you have to appreciate the right moment to make them"", he said.The honour was given to President Putin during a period of relatively close French-Russian relations. But Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February last year has resulted in widespread condemnation and the European Union imposing tough economic sanctions on Moscow. While Mr Macron has condemned the invasion, he has repeatedly spoken to Mr Putin by phone in an effort to broker a ceasefire and negotiations.The French attempts to maintain a dialogue with the Kremlin contrast with the US and UK positions.Ukraine's foreign minister hit out at Mr Macron in October after he said it was vital that Russia was not humiliated over its invasion.Mr Putin is not the first controversial world leader to be handed France's highest honour. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was decorated with the award by Mr Chirac in 2001, shortly after taking power following the death of his father Hafez al-Assad.The award was returned in 2018, with Syria saying Mr al-Assad would not wear the award of a ""slave"" to the United States.In 2016, then-President Francois Hollande awarded the title to former Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, citing for his ""efforts in the fight against terrorism and extremism"". This was soon after Mr Hollande had condemned mass executions in Saudi Arabia.And it would not be the first time Mr Macron has stripped someone of the honour. He withdrew the award from Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein after a series of accusations of sexual harassment and rape.WW2 codebreaker receives French honourVeteran, 95, given Legion d'Honneur'I'd do the war again tomorrow'"
31,Ethiopia Orthodox Church split: Social media restricted,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64597375,"Ethiopia has restricted social media and messaging platforms ahead of rival planned rallies following a split in the popular Orthodox Church.The row has caused deadly violence and began last month when some clerics accused the main church of ethnic discrimination, which it denies.The authorities banned protests by both sides due to take place on Sunday.Some supporters of the main church angrily accuse the authorities of backing the breakaway group.They had vowed online to defy the ban and go ahead with their rally as a show of strength for the Orthodox Church, which is one of the oldest in sub-Saharan Africa and one of the few in the region to exist before the arrival of European missionaries.There are fears of a complete internet shutdown in the coming days. It is a tactic commonly used in the country - which has a population of 115 million - though rarely in the capital, Addis Ababa.Some areas of the northern region of Tigray, where a brutal two-year conflict came to an end in November after a peace deal brokered by the African Union (AU), remain without access to the internet.Netblocks, an organisation that monitors internet access, said the current restrictions are affecting Facebook, Messenger, Telegram and TikTok.Those with virtual private network (VPN) software can get on to those sites, but a total shutdown would prevent that.London-based VPN research firm TOP10VPN said demand for VPNs in Ethiopia skyrocketed by 1,430% on Friday. The authorities have also closed schools on Friday as tension mounts in the deeply religious society - and there are concerns the situation may escalate further. The authorities are also preparing for the annual AU summit, which is due to be held next week. It will be the organisation's first meeting since the Tigray deal was signed and the government will be anxious to avoid unrest in Addis Ababa, which is where the AU's headquarters is based.Three archbishops from Oromia, which surrounds Addis Ababa and is the country's most populous region, accused the leadership of the main church of discrimination and a lack of diversity.They say for too long the Orthodox Church has been dominated culturally by other ethnic groups. Amharic, for example, is the working language of the country, and the patriarch, its influential leader, is an ethnic Tigrayan.The dissenting clerics said services should be held in the Oromo language - and though the main church says this happens, they say not nearly enough.The archbishops, who have been excommunicated after setting up a breakaway synod, say they have a great deal of support in Oromia and had organised a counter rally in Addis Ababa.But in a blow for the dissenters, a court placed an injunction on them on Friday, banning them and the clergy they have recently appointed from entering churches belonging to the Orthodox Church.The fallout may also have a political element.Some analysts say the patriarch, Abune Mathias, has not been on good terms with the authorities since speaking out about the war in Tigray, controversially saying that a genocide was being committed there.Its planned rally was to show off the strength of its support. It was angered after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed instructed his cabinet ministers to keep out of the matter, feeling the government should take its side.Following the rally ban and the social media restrictions, it has been announced that Mr Abiy is meeting the patriarch, so tensions may ease over the next few days.The state-linked Ethiopian Human Rights Commission has also stepped into the fray, releasing a statement on Friday accusing the security forces of using excessive force against followers of the main church.It refers to extrajudicial killings, beatings, harassment and arbitrary arrests and says eight people were killed during religious clashes last Saturday in Shashamane, a town in Oromia.How Ethiopia has changed over the last 50 yearsFrom monk to soldier - how war has split a churchWhy Ethiopia‚Äôs 'alphabet generation' feel betrayedThe country where a year lasts 13 monthsA quick guide to EthiopiaAfrica Today podcasts"

33,Grieving a daughter's Covid death in Wuhan - while being surveilled,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64143646,"""The pain lasts for a lifetime. Even healing a little is difficult."" It's been three years since Yang Min's only child, Yuxi, died. The 24-year-old had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was admitted to hospital in mid-January 2020 in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the earliest coronavirus cases were detected. Wuhan was the first place in China - and the world - to be locked down to stop the spread of Covid. The announcement came in the early hours of 23 January and it sent people, scared and uncertain, fleeing into the night. That city-wide lockdown, lasting 76 days, would become integral to China's zero-Covid playbook. The country has now scrapped the policy and recently announced that the current wave, driven by a hasty reopening, is drawing to a close. But as much of China moves on, Ms Yang cannot. She says she will not rest until she finds ""justice"" for her daughter. She believes Yuxi would not have died had the government warned the public at the beginning of the pandemic. When Yuxi went to the hospital in 2020, Wuhan was gearing up for the Chinese New Year celebration - large family dinners, streets filled with shoppers, and the city covered in festive red, customary during the Spring Festival. In an interview with a book author, Ms Yang said Yuxi's illness didn't dampen the family's holiday spirit because they were confident she would recover. What Ms Yang didn't know was that a new virus was spreading in the city and through its hospitals. Reports had emerged in December 2019 of a mysterious illness that was believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Market. But authorities assured people that there was ""no definite evidence"" of human-to-human transmission. Then cases began to rise and by 19 January, when Yuxi developed a fever, Wuhan had recorded nearly 200 cases. On 23 January, when the government locked down the city of 11 million, doctors told Ms Yang that Yuxi would not survive if her fever did not subside. Over the following days, Yuxi didn't stop coughing. Her breathing became laboured and she vomited blood. Ms Yang, who spent day and night taking care of her, also caught the virus. On 6 February Yuxi died alone, after spending five days in the ICU. Ms Yang, who had been battling the virus in an isolated ward, was not told until two weeks later. Ms Yang detailed these events to Murong Xuecun, a well-known writer who recorded her account and others' in Deadly Quiet City: Stories from Wuhan, Covid Ground Zero. When Ms Yang speaks to the BBC, she says it is too painful to recount - but she talks more about her Yuxi and what life has been like since she died.""My daughter didn't have any exceptional quality, but she was my daughter, so I miss her. That's what mothers do,"" she says, crying. ""She was the same as other children. Sometimes she was naughty, sometimes she didn't listen to me, sometimes we argued.""While Ms Yang did not know about the virus at the time, doctors and medical workers in Wuhan suspected something was amiss. Mr Chen, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, was working at a community health centre when the outbreak began. He had been in the job for more than a decade and had heard about a new virus from colleagues - well before Dr Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old whistle-blower who died of the disease, was reprimanded by authorities for ""spreading rumours"". Mr Chen said they knew it was a coronavirus, but not much beyond that. ""We were all in fear because we had no idea,"" he says. ""Now I think about it, it was inconceivable. Nobody could have thought that it would turn out like this.""Although the Wuhan lockdown was spun as a success by Beijing, the death toll from the early weeks - before lockdown - remains unknown. Louise, a tech worker in her late 20s who stayed in Wuhan with her partner through the lockdown, says it was frightening initially, before the cases began to fall: ""There were videos showing the bodies on the ground in the hospitals and our food was almost gone... We were afraid that we were being abandoned.""It wasn't until early April - on tomb sweeping day, when Chinese mourn the dead by placing white paper in a circle - that she realised how badly the city had been hit by the virus. There were circles of white everywhere and chrysanthemums, the preferred choice of flower for mourners, were sold out. ""No-one I know had died of the virus, but I was shocked by the scene,"" Louise says.Ms Yang was one of those mourners three years ago. She says some of her fear and pain was relived this year when China was gripped by a wave of infections as it reopened. This time Ms Yang's mother-in-law, who is in her 80s, was infected. ""I was worried she could die at any moment,"" she says. ""I did everything I didn't do three years ago, everything I had regretted not doing, everything I didn't know then but know now. I was afraid I would put her in harm's way if I was careless with anything... I checked her blood oxygen level every hour."" Ms Yang caught Covid again, but she says she wasn't afraid for herself.  ""After what we had experienced, death means little. I don't want to experience the loss of family anymore. If I could, I would die for my mother-in-law."" Her mother-in-law survived - and recovered before the start of the Chinese New Year in late January. But Ms Yang wasn't in a celebratory mood. She had been under heavy surveillance since speaking to the media about losing her daughter to Covid.She protested on the streets and has been trying to file a lawsuit against the government. She says she wants ""an explanation"".China is a one party-state which does not tolerate protests that challenge the leadership. The media and the internet are also heavily censored, with many foreign news outlets being banned in the country. People who talk critically about the country to foreign media often face retribution - from warnings to even detention. With technology, China has also established an extensive surveillance network that monitors mobile device data and tracks movements.  Ms Yang says: ""There are people at my door and I am followed everywhere. There is no Spring Festival atmosphere because I am worried I will affect my friends if I go to gatherings. I haven't gone out much.""In Wuhan, on the first day of the Chinese New Year, people visit the homes of those whose relatives have died in the past year, and burn incense for the dead.""Chrysanthemums were being sold everywhere, especially on Chinese New Year's Eve,"" she says, adding that it brought back harrowing memories because she had brought two baskets of the flowers for Yuxi. For Ms Yang, the end of the pandemic does not mean a return to normal life. Not least because there is now a camera at her door, monitoring her every day. ""I am not afraid of them,"" she says. ""I have already lost the most precious thing in life. What else can they take away from me?"" Except for Yang Min, names have been changed to protect identities.

34,Sergei Furgal: Ex-Russian regional governor jailed in murder cases,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64601407,"A former governor from Russia's Far East has been sentenced to 22 years in jail for murder and attempted murder in a controversial court case in Moscow.Sergei Furgal insists he is innocent and says the trial against him was motivated by politics.He was elected governor of Khabarovsk region in 2018, unexpectedly beating the Kremlin's preferred candidate.His detention in July 2020 caused widespread anger among locals.The judge in Luberetsky Court near the capital ruled that Furgal, 52, must serve his sentence in a high-security prison after a jury found him guilty on two charges of murder and one of attempted murder. The killings, said the prosecution, were linked to rivalry between Furgal and other businessmen in 2004 and 2005. The ex-governor - who won office as a candidate for the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) - struggled to contain his emotions in the courtroom after the sentence was read out, shouting ""Do you have no shame?"" at the judge. His lawyers say they will appeal.When he was first arrested, residents in the city of Khabarovsk took to the streets in huge numbers - some estimates put the figure as high as 50,000. Such demonstrations are rare in Russia and took the Kremlin by surprise.Furgal's supporters claimed that the criminal case against him was politically motivated - punishment for daring to beat the Kremlin's candidate in elections.Experts say his landslide victory was the result of a massive anti-Moscow vote. As governor, he was tough-talking, and some say more popular even than President Vladimir Putin.Contract killings of business rivals were common in Russia, especially in the 1990s and the early 2000s, when Furgal was a successful businessman.However, the case is more likely to be linked to his unique position - as a popular local politician who didn't show absolute loyalty to the Kremlin.""Furgal may well have been involved in shadowy business in the past, but so too were many of the other regional leaders whom Putin has been happy to support,"" Russia expert Mark Galeotti told the BBC. ""It seems clear that this was essentially a political move: once the Kremlin decided Furgal had to go, they looked for whatever excuse they could use.""The Khabarovsk protest movement in 2020 was unusual for two reasons. Firstly, it was grassroots-based: meaning the authorities could not simply arrest the ringleaders.Secondly, it was focused on a single local issue - the arrest of the governor - making it very difficult for the Kremlin to pin the blame on the West or on ""foreign forces"" - as is the usual tactic.But in the weeks that followed, arrests were made, and the demonstrators were eventually silenced or pushed off the streets. President Putin appointed a new governor, Mikhail Degtyaryov, who also represents the LDPR. Mr Degtyarov, though, is a Kremlin loyalist and recently became a vocal supporter of Russia's war in Ukraine.The arrest fuelling anger in Russia's far eastThe protests that are 'an embarrassment' for PutinPutin picks new governor in protest-hit region"
35,Ethiopia's online horrors: 'I saw my father's dead body on Facebook',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64518964,"When Ethiopian university student Moti Dereje logged into his Facebook account in late November 2018, he was expecting to see the usual updates from his friends and family.Instead, the 19-year-old - who was studying in the capital, Addis Ababa - saw a shocking post.""As I refreshed my news feed, I saw my father's dead body lying there,"" he told the BBC's The Comb podcast.Not only was Mr Moti devastated by seeing such a horrific image, but this was how he found out that his father had been killed. ""I kind of froze at that moment. It was really shocking for me,"" he says.With Ethiopia experiencing political unrest in various regions over the last few years, social media has been flooded with graphic images and videos, disinformation and posts inciting violence.Activists have been calling for more to be done to moderate the platforms and take down such content before it causes harm.For Mr Moti, rather than seeing the picture taken down, he started to see more posts showing the same image.His father, a former MP who was working as a university administrator, was the target of a political killing in western Oromia.The region was going through a period of turmoil at the time with frequent assassinations.""It's like they were celebrating killing him. It was actually painful,"" Mr Moti explains.The BBC has seen 15 of these posts, which Mr Moti says he reported to Facebook in the hope that they would be taken down.Facebook's Community Standards state it will remove ""videos and photos that show the violent death of someone when a family member requests its removal"".But for over four years, and after Mr Moti says he reported the posts multiple times, they stayed online. Only a graphic content warning was applied to some of the pictures. ""Sometimes I get depressed and I can't stop my hand searching his name and checking out the posts. I'm kind of traumatised I think,"" Mr Moti says.When the BBC approached Facebook's parent company Meta for comment, it agreed that while the pictures alone did not violate its policy on violent and graphic content, it would take down the posts because of a family member's request. All the posts showing the picture of Mr Moti's dead father have now been removed. There is currently no mechanism in Facebook's reporting system for family members to make these requests, but Meta told the BBC that it was testing a new form to allow for this. Concern has been mounting about the volume of graphic content and hate speech being shared on Ethiopian social media.This was a problem prior to 2020, but when the war in the northern Tigray region broke out in November of that year, the amount of violence making its way into people's newsfeeds increased dramatically.In 2021 Facebook's Oversight Board recommended that the company commission an independent investigation for Ethiopia specifically, to review how the platform has been used to spread hate speech and add to the violence.This review has not been undertaken. The BBC asked Meta about this, and a spokesperson highlighted a previous response from the company, saying it would assess the feasibility of such a review - and that it had previously conducted multiple forms of human rights due diligence related to Ethiopia.Last year it was announced that Meta was being sued by two Ethiopians who allege Facebook's algorithm helped fuel the viral spread of hate and violence.Meta responded saying it invested heavily in moderation and technology to remove hate.But Rehobot Ayalew, a fact-checking consultant based in Addis Ababa, questions how much is being done by social media companies to address the problem.""I don't think the platforms are giving that much attention to Ethiopia,"" she told The Comb.""I know Facebook says that it has moderators who focus on Ethiopia, who are Amharic speakers and Tigrinya speakers, but we don't know how many. And they are not even working from Ethiopia, they are working in Kenya.""The impact of this, according to Ms Rehobot, is that violent content often stays online far too long.""It usually takes a long time for a toxic post to be taken down,"" she says.Ms Rehobot references a video which was shared widely in March 2022, in which a Tigrayan man was burned alive.""First of all, the artificial intelligence by itself should have removed it,"" she explains.""Then even after it gets reported, it should have been removed quickly, but it stayed for some hours.""A Meta spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have strict rules which outline what is and isn't allowed on Facebook and Instagram. Hate speech and incitement to violence are against these rules and we invest heavily in teams and technology to help us find and remove this content.""We employ staff with local knowledge and expertise, and continue to develop our capabilities to catch violating content in the most widely spoken languages in the country, including Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya.""   Some good can come when public attention is drawn to heinous human rights abuses, but content like this can also be used to whip up anger and place blame on specific ethnic groups or individuals.All the while the traumatic effects of viewing such content is felt by thousands, if not millions, of Ethiopians.In November last year a peace deal was signed with the aim of bringing an end to the war in Tigray and starting to address the dire humanitarian situation it has caused. Estimates of the number of people killed are in the hundreds of thousands, with the majority of those deaths caused by hunger and lack of medical supplies as a result of the fighting. Meanwhile unrest still rocks the Oromia region, which has seen a growing rebellion.  Activists fear that reconciliation in these cases will be hampered by the violence that haunts social media. ""People tend to believe [the posts] and act upon them, so widespread violent and destructive images can surely slow the process of peace and reconciliation,"" says Ms Rehobot. Now aged 23, Mr Moti is trying to move on with his life, pursuing a career as a videographer and photographer, and is even making a documentary about his own experience.""I think it is the time I tell my own story trying to fight back and maybe, if I succeed, maybe I can bring a change,"" he says.But he says the prevalence of graphic content will trouble him until it is brought under control.""Whenever I see a dead body posted online or on Facebook due to the Ethiopian war, I really feel saddened. Somebody's going to be feeling what I've been through.""It really kills me.""Listen to the full episode of The Comb podcast, When violence goes viral.Rebellion crackles in Ethiopian PM's backyardThe boy named Wealthy who weighs half what he shouldNasa shows how a war zone faded from spaceWhy Facebook and Twitter are under fire in EthiopiaFacebook says Ethiopian PM's post incited violenceThe Comb"

37,Cuban exodus: 'I just don't see a future here for me',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-64559657,"An accomplished pitcher and first baseman from Havana, 12-year-old Deivid Acosta's eyes light up when he talks of potentially playing competitive baseball in the United States.  He's now tantalisingly close. Thanks to an agreement reached a few years ago, Cuban children will compete for the first time in the Little League World Series in Pennsylvania in August.  Deivid is confident of making the cut.Batting in Havana's morning heat, the two-times Cuban homerun leader in his age category delivered an assured performance in front of an important visitor: the president of US Little League, Stephen Keener.""The New York Yankees, always,"" Deivid says with a smile when asked where he sees himself playing one day.  Yet unlike top baseball prospects from the Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico, his route to the Major League in the US is far from assured.  Like most Cubans, Deivid has grown up under the twin complexities of the US trade embargo and communist rule. A tangled bureaucratic combination of the two has long restricted opportunities for young players like Deivid and his teammates to travel or train abroad.  Mr Keener tacitly acknowledged the embargo's impact on Cuba's youth teams by promising to supply bats, gloves, balls and one day ""build a Little League field in Cuba"".But scarcity is simply a part of the players' young lives, often of more important things than baseball gloves: eggs, bread, soap, medicines. The list of shortages changes but never ends.On 7 February 1962, President John F Kennedy extended the embargo to include virtually every export. It's now the longest-running economic sanction in the world.  Under the embargo, cargo ships cannot dock in US ports for 180 days if they've previously docked in Cuba, deterring international freight companies from shipping to the island. White goods, car parts or medical equipment with US-made components are also banned from sale to Cuba.In 2018, the United Nations called the embargo on Cuba ""unjust"" and said it had cost the island's economy some $130bn (¬£108bn) over the past six decades.That the embargo is harsh is rarely contested by Washington. Indeed, it is intended to be.But it's also the source of an eternal blame game: Is the US sanction the cause of Cuba's dire economic problems and scarcity, or is it the perfect excuse behind which the Cuban state hides its own shortcomings and failings?  For every die-hard revolutionary who insists the embargo is solely to blame for Cuba's ills, there's an equally committed opponent pointing the finger squarely at Cuban communism.  ""One way to look at it is that the two things have interacted with each other over six decades to produce a catastrophe, an economic and social catastrophe,"" says Ricardo Torres, a Cuban economist and research fellow at American University in Washington DC.  ""Clearly, the embargo puts additional strain on Cuba's development. But I think currently the main constraint is the system, the country's economic model."" Whatever one's position on that endless debate, the dire circumstances have undeniably sparked an exodus, the like of which the island hasn't seen in years. Miriela Cruz is among those desperate to leave Cuba soon. A cancer patient and mother of two, she spoke to the BBC in August 2021 after her son was jailed in a dragnet of arrests following nationwide anti-government demonstrations the month before. Street protests are banned in Cuba and the government clamps down on all forms of dissent.Drawn and exhausted from her chemotherapy treatment, she was physically and emotionally drained.  Speaking out about her son's detention put Miriela into direct conflict with the authorities. Now deemed a ""counter-revolutionary"", she's found life even tougher and says she's subject to constant harassment from Cuba's state security.  ""I honestly want to leave this country more than anything. With my health issues, there aren't any of the medicines I need, not even painkillers. There's no food - I have days where I simply don't eat anything. I just don't see a future here for me."" The state-run centrally controlled model has failed to deliver for people like Miriela, argues economist Ricardo Torres, while the embargo has allowed the Cuban authorities to ""look the other way in terms of things which need to be addressed"".  Whether relaxing controls on the private sector, reform of the dysfunctional banking system or easing the military's vice-like grip over the import-export business, the Cuban government ""still has a lot of agency when it comes to transforming the reality of the country,"" he adds. With so many Cubans arriving on US shores, the Biden administration has now introduced a new humanitarian visa plan. Every day, long queues of people clutching their paperwork line up outside the US embassy in Havana.  With most of Cuba's arable land cultivated by oxen-and-plough or Soviet-era tractors, a green shoot of improved ties came from Joe Biden's home state, Delaware. A visiting agricultural delegation spoke of their hopes for a more normal trade relationship, insisting ""the potential for collaboration today is greater than ever before"". Yet Cubans have heard such talk before - particularly during the Obama-era thaw between Washington and Havana - and are fully aware that only the US Congress can lift the embargo. Given the deep divisions in the House of Representatives, that appears a very distant prospect. Meanwhile, Miriela's health remains so precarious, she's contemplating the ultimate risk: crossing the Florida Straits in a boat. ""Whatever I have left to live, whether two years, three days, a month, I want to live it with dignity,"" she says. ""Here there's no tomorrow, no hope.""

38,AKA shot dead: Top South African rapper killed with friend,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64608537,"One of South Africa's leading rappers, popularly known as AKA, has been shot dead outside a restaurant in the coastal city of Durban.Kiernan Forbes was killed along with his close friend, the chef and entrepreneur Tebello 'Tibz' Motsoane.The pair are thought to have been on their way to a nightclub for a performance as part of Forbes' birthday celebrations when they were shot. The motive of the killing is being investigated.Police spokesperson Colonel Robert Netshiunda has told the BBC that the rapper and his friend were walking to their car when they were approached by two armed men who shot them at close range. The assailants then fled the scene on foot.Police have said they don't want to speculate on whether the murders were a result of a hit but said that possibility cannot be ruled out.  Forbes began his musical career as part of the rap group Entity before he launched his solo career, winning several awards in South Africa for his music. He was also celebrated internationally, with several nominations for a Black Entertainment Television (BET) Award in the US and an MTV Europe Music Award. Hours before his death, the 35-year-old posted on social media about his upcoming album, Mass Country, which is set for release later this month. Forbes' parents have paid tribute to him in a statement posted on one of his social media accounts.""To us, Kiernan Jarryd Forbes was a son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin and friend, most importantly father to his beloved daughter Kairo,"" they wrote. ""To many, he was AKA, Supa Mega, Bhova and the many other names of affection his legion of fans called him by. Our son was loved and gave love in return.""Motsoane, who was also AKA's former manager, has been described on social media as ""a true gentleman"".South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world and shootings are not uncommon.

40,Turkey earthquake rescue efforts disrupted by security concerns,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64608535,"Unrest in southern Turkey has disrupted rescue efforts in some places following Monday's deadly earthquake, three rescue groups have said.The death toll in Turkey and Syria from the quake has surpassed 28,000, and hope of finding many more survivors is fading despite some miraculous rescues. German rescuers and the Austrian army paused search operations on Saturday, citing clashes between unnamed groups.Security is expected to worsen as food supplies dwindle, one rescuer said.Turkey's president said he would use emergency powers to punish anyone breaking the law.An Austrian army spokesperson said early on Saturday that clashes between unidentified groups in the Hatay province had left dozens of personnel from the Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit seeking shelter in a base camp with other international organisations. ""There is increasing aggression between factions in Turkey,"" Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Kugelweis said in a statement. ""The chances of saving a life bears no reasonable relation to the safety risk.""Hours after Austria paused its rescue efforts, the country's ministry of defence said that the Turkish army had stepped in to offer protection, allowing the rescue operations to resume.The German branch of the search and rescue group ISAR and Germany's Federal Agency for Technical Relief (TSW) also suspended operations, citing security concerns.""There are more and more reports of clashes between different factions, shots have also been fired,"" said ISAR spokesperson Stefan Heine.Steven Bayer, operations manager of Isar, said he expected security to worsen as food, water, and hope become more scarce. ""We are watching the security situation very closely as it develops,"" he said. German rescue teams said they would resume work as soon as Turkish authorities deem the situation safe, Reuters news agency reported. The Vice President of Turkey, Fuat Oktay announced on Saturday the death toll in Turkey has risen to 24,617.While Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan hasn't commented on the reported unrest in Hatay, he did reiterate on Saturday that the government would take action against those involved in crimes in the region.""We've declared a state of emergency,"" Mr Erdogan said during a visit to the disaster zone today. ""It means that, from now on, the people who are involved in looting or kidnapping should know that the state's firm hand is on their backs.""State media reported on Saturday that 48 people had been arrested for looting, according to AFP. Turkish state media reported several guns were seized, along with cash, jewellery and bank cards.A 26-year-old man searching for a work colleague in a collapsed building in Antakya told Reuters: ""People were smashing the windows and fences of shops and cars."" Turkish police have also reportedly detained 12 people over collapsed buildings in the provinces of Gaziantep and Sanliurfa. They included contractors, according to the DHA news agency. There are also expected to be more arrests after Mr Oktay told reporters late Saturday that prosecutors issued 113 arrest warrants over the buildings.At least 6,000 buildings collapsed in Turkey, raising questions about if the large-scale tragedy could have been avoided and whether President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government could have done more to save lives.With elections looming, the president's future is on the line after spending 20 years in power and his pleas for national unity going unheeded.Mr Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but he appeared to blame fate on a visit to one disaster zone: ""Such things have always happened. It's part of destiny's plan.""Among those rescued on Saturday were a family of five pulled from the rubble in Turkey's Gaziantep province.AP news agency reported the parents, two daughters and son were brought to safety after five days under their collapsed home, to cries of ""God is great"". The same outlet reported that a seven-year-old girl was pulled from the debris in the province of Hatay after almost 132 hours under the rubble.

""We have more than a hundred countries who have sent people here so there's been incredible response but there's a need for it,"" he added.Mr Griffiths has called for regional politics to be put aside in the face of the disaster - and there are some signs that this is happening. The border crossing between long-feuding Armenia and Turkey reopened on Saturday for the first time in 35 years to allow aid through.And there are reports that the Syrian government has agreed to let UN aid into areas controlled by opposition groups, with whom they have been engaged in a bitter civil war since 2011. The death toll in Syria from the earthquake now stands at more than 3,500, according to AFP - but new figures have not been publishes since Friday. There has been criticism that the international effort to send aid to Syria has not been fast enough. Ismail al Abdullah of the Syrian Civil Defence Force, or White Helmets, which operates in rebel-held areas, told the BBC's Quentin Sommerville that the organisation had stopped searching for survivors.The international community has ""blood on its hands,"" he said. ""We needed rescue equipment that never came.""Sivanka Dhanapala, the Syria representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told AlJazeera that as many 5.3 million Syrians may be homeless following the quake.

41,Namibia baby abandonment law: 'I wanted someone to take better care of my son',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64451313,"The discovery of the dead body of a newborn baby abandoned behind a school in the Namibian capital, Windhoek, last November shows that a change in the law was not enough to solve the problem.In 2019, Namibia passed legislation saying that women who, out of desperation, took the drastic step of abandoning their child, would no longer be prosecuted.Safe places where an infant could be left were established, but there is still not enough awareness of the legal changes.Two years ago, Linda, which is not her real name, used one of these places to leave her child.Linda cries when she talks about the baby she had to give up.""It was not an easy decision, as a mother, to carry a baby for nine months and give it away. But I still did it because of the situation I was in,"" Linda says in a low voice. She is talking about being unable to afford another child.Linda shares a tiny house with her other children and her boyfriend in an informal settlement near the coastal town of Swakopmund.She sometimes finds it difficult to afford a meal, and says her four children understand that if ""mum has nothing today, we will not eat today"". She adds: ""But for the fifth born, if there is no meal, he would not understand anything. So I just thought: 'I have to give this baby away, to someone who would take better care of him.'""Linda is remorseful but believes she did the best for her baby at the time.""I do miss him, I miss my baby because I breastfed him for three days, but I know he's okay, he's with the right people.""The reason she knows he is being looked after is that she left him in what is called a baby-saver box - a drawer built into a wall of a compound in Swakopmund that has a mattress and a blanket inside. There is also a letter.""Dearest mommy‚Ä¶ please know that we do not judge you,"" reads the reassuring note.""We cannot begin to understand the circumstances that have brought you [here],"" it adds.The message is from the Ruach Elohim Foundation, which was set up in Swakopmund by Ronel Peters and her husband Dick to create a haven for babies.""We received this little one, only yesterday,"" Mrs Peters says, cradling a tiny boy.""He's four days old. Unfortunately we were very busy, we haven't even named him yet.""The baby-saver box is her foundation's initiative and there are similar projects elsewhere in the world.The box, the first and only in Namibia, is one way that mothers can bring babies, usually newborns, and leave them anonymously in a safe place to be found and cared for. It was already in existence before the law changed but Mrs Peters is hoping to set up more, elsewhere in the country.Any time a baby is left in the box, Mrs Peters and her team of seven receive a notification on their phones and someone then goes to collect the infant. The mother has 30 days to claim her baby back if she changes her mind.""If the 30 days elapse and she doesn't come back, then obviously we assume she is happy with the decision she made, and‚Ä¶ this baby can be registered as an adoptive baby in Namibia,"" Mrs Peters explains.Inside the home, there is a board on the wall with photos of the babies and the dates they each came in. Nikolai, Miracle, Gabriel and Joshua are just a few that make up the display.The baby-saver box is just one way that children arrive and, since it was established just over four years ago, 10 babies have been left there.But despite the change in the law, babies continue to be abandoned in unsafe places.According to police statistics, between 2018 and 2022 close to 140 babies were abandoned nationwide - far more than those left in safe places, and a high number given the country's small population of just 2.5 million.Mrs Peters wishes more people were aware of the baby-saver box.""Mothers must be educated that they are allowed to leave their babies, unharmed, at a safe place, and anonymously, if they wish to do so. ""Every time I hear of another baby that was dumped, I feel very guilty, it feels that it's my fault, because I didn't do enough awareness.""Poverty, such as in the case of Linda, is one reason why mothers feel they are not able to look after a child. But other babies have been abandoned because their mothers felt they were too young, or they were the result of a rape, or that fathers have walked away from the family, says Donata Tshivoro, a leading social worker at the gender ministry.The move to decriminalise baby abandonment in 2019 was made to encourage mothers to leave their babies in safe places, such as a hospital or police station - or in a baby-saver box.The child must show no sign of abuse, neglect, or malnutrition. Once the baby is handed in, the child is given to a social worker. Mercia Chingwaramusee, a social worker who works on this issue, acknowledges that despite the change in the law, there is a stigma and ""the fear of people knowing that you went to drop your child there"".Nevertheless, she adds that a mother making the decision to give up her child as she is unable to keep them is actually giving that baby ""an opportunity to live"".The authorities acknowledge that more still needs to be done to make people aware of the safe way to leave a baby to prevent further deaths.""We do talk on radios, in different vernacular languages, we do go to schools, and we do community meetings, the social workers also go to the head men at the village,"" Ms Tshivoro says.While there are now safe ways to give up a child, troubling feelings for people like Linda never go away. ""I just pray to God that one day he will forgive me,"" she says, ""or maybe come to me one day.""'Baby bin' to save South Africa's unwanted childrenCan these boxes found on US streets save babies‚Äô lives?Namibia country profile"
42,Turkey-Syria earthquake: New-born and mother saved after four days in rubble,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64593486,"A new-born baby and his mother have been rescued from rubble in Turkey, around 90 hours after the first of Monday's deadly earthquakes.The 10-day-old boy, named Yagiz, was retrieved from a ruined structure in the southern Hatay province.Footage showed the child being carefully taken out overnight - a sight described by local media as miraculous.Hopes of finding many more survivors are diminishing, amid freezing-cold weather four days after the disaster.However, search and rescue efforts continue in both Turkey and neighbouring Syria - which was struck by the quakes as well. New-born Yagiz was pictured wrapped in a thermal blanket being carried to an ambulance to receive treatment.His mother was brought out on a stretcher. There were no further updates immediately available over the health of both.Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu - whose teams were reportedly involved in the rescue - tweeted about the rescue, saying it happened in the town of Samandag.Footage obtained by the Reuters news agency also showed a man being retrieved from the ruins, though it was not known if he had any connection to the other two.More than 21,000 people have died - most of them in Turkey - after Monday morning's initial 7.8-magnitude tremor and the hundreds of aftershocks that followed.There have also been fears of a secondary catastrophe, as many people have been made homeless and are lacking shelter, water, fuel and electricity.Turkish President Recap Tayyip Erdogan has described it as the ""disaster of the century"".Opposition figures have accused Mr Erdogan of failing to prepare for the earthquake and have questioned how estimated 88bn lira ($4.6bn; ¬£3.8bn) raised from an ""earthquake tax"" was spent. The levy - first imposed in the wake of a massive quake in 1999 that killed more than 17,000 people - was meant to have been spent on disaster prevention and the development of emergency services. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party said on Wednesday that Mr Erdogan's government ""has not prepared for an earthquake for 20 years"". Despite the devastation, stories of remarkable escapes or heroic rescues have been emerging over the past days.Thousands of people have offered to adopt a baby girl who was born under a collapsed building in north-west Syria.When she was rescued, baby Aya - meaning miracle in Arabic - was still connected by her umbilical cord to her mother, who died along with other family members.This video can not be playedWatch: Earthquake rescues offer hope in Turkey and SyriaIcy weather stokes fears as quake toll tops 22,000Thousands offer to adopt baby born under rubbleBodies found in search for school volleyball teams"
43,China seeks 'bold' steps to lift birth rate,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64594469,"A senior health official in Beijing has urged China's local leaders to find ways to boost the country's birth rate.Yang Wenzhuang said officials must take active steps to tackle the detrimental effects of China's long-standing anti-population growth policy.He also urged officials to ""make bold innovations"" in tackling the cost of childcare and education.China reported in January that its population had fallen for the first time in 60 years.In 2022, there was just 6.77 births per 1,000 people in China, the lowest birth rate on record and down from 7.52 births in the previous year.The country's strict one-child policy - which was implemented from 1980 to 2015 to respond to runaway population growth - has been blamed for the decline. Families that broke the rules were fined and, in some cases, even lost jobs.The limit was increased nationally for married couples to two in 2016, and boosted further to three in 2021. But one province - Sichuan - has adopted even looser rules. Mr Yang - who heads the country's Population Monitoring and Family Development department - said officials had to ""firmly grasp the important window period of population development"". Speaking to a state-backed health magazine, Mr Yang said concerns about the cost of childcare were having a detrimental impact on population growth. He also identified challenges around money and career goals as causes for the decline. ""Local governments should be encouraged to actively explore and make bold innovations in reducing the cost of childbirth, childcare and education"" to promote the long-term balanced development of the population, Mr Yang said. Some provinces have already begun implementing new measures to try to boost the birth rate, including giving money to sperm donors.In Sichuan, health authorities said they would allow unmarried couples to raise a family and enjoy benefits reserved for married couples. Previously there was a ban on single women registering a birth.Authorities in the region also announced that couples would be allowed to have as many children as they want - a major reversal of the one-child policy. A shrinking population, falling birth rate and the prospect of a fast-aging population poses a long-term challenge to the world's second largest economy, which only recently dropped ultra-strict Covid-19 curbs.In 2022, the population dropped by 850,000 people to 1.41175 billion, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. It was the first decline since 1961, the last year of China's Great Famine.A surging Indian population also threatens to overtake China and push it down to second place.Unlimited children for couples in Chinese provinceShould China worry about its shrinking population?Living under China's one-child policy"
44,New Zealand storm Gabrielle: Tense wait as ex-cyclone moves over North Island,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64617013,"This video can not be playedWatch: Huge waves and heavy rain as Cyclone Gabrielle lashes New ZealandResidents across the north of New Zealand are bracing for a rough night as Cyclone Gabrielle lashes the country with torrential rains and winds.At least 46,000 homes have lost power in the storm, while hundreds of flights have been cancelled.A state of emergency has been declared in nine regions - affecting nearly a third of the 5.1 million population.The storm was expected to peak on Monday night with the deluge to continue until Tuesday.In New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, authorities earlier evacuated people from 50 homes around a 30m-high tower that was in danger of collapse, local media reported. Dozens of evacuation centres have also been set up in the city.Emergency services have also reported people trapped by the rising waters - including a family stranded on a flooded highway. Authorities say they've received more than 100 calls for help since Sunday.Cyclone Gabrielle is hitting New Zealand's north just weeks after Auckland and surrounding areas endured record rainfall and flooding which killed four people.New Zealand's Prime Minister Chris Hipkins was among those stranded in the northern city on Monday after flights to the capital Wellington, and elsewhere, were cancelled.""Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event,"" he said. ""Things are likely to get worse before they get better."" He announced a NZ$11.5m (¬£6m; US$7.3m) aid package on Monday.Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said the government was considering declaring a national state of emergency for only the third time in the country's history.Once an emergency is declared, local authorities have greater power to respond to dangerous situations including restricting travel and providing aid.New Zealand's meteorological agency, Metservice, said Whangarei, a city north of Auckland, had received 100.5mm of rain in the past 12 hours. Mr McAnulty had warned Monday would be a ""critical day"" due to the ""highly dangerous"" combination of high winds and heavy rain. Winds of up to 140km/h (87mph) battered the Northland region, while the Auckland Harbour Bridge had to be closed as it was rocked by gusts of 110km/h.For homes left without power, the minister warned it could also take days to restore the power grid as the bad weather made it ""unsafe"" to work on the network.Weather officials had earlier downgraded Gabrielle's intensity, but the Metservice in its latest update on Monday said it would still bring ""significant heavy rain and potentially damaging winds"".Although the cyclone has yet to make landfall, it has already toppled trees, damaged roads and downed power lines.Many schools and local government facilities across Auckland and the North Island have closed and people are being asked not to travel before Tuesday.Meanwhile some 10,000 international Air New Zealand customers were disrupted by the cancellation of 509 flights. Normal services are expected to resume Tuesday, with the national carrier adding 11 extra domestic flights to its schedule to help with recovery efforts.This video can not be playedMore flooding rains for New Zealand's North IslandNew Zealand braces as ex-cyclone Gabrielle closes inFlood-hit Auckland suffers more heavy rainFlash flooding in Auckland kills four"

46,Moldovan government resigns in wake of multiple crises,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64595322,"Moldova's government has collapsed and its pro-EU prime minister has stepped down after 18 months of political and economic turbulence.Europe's poorest country was struggling with ""multiple crises"", outgoing PM Natalia Gavrilita said on Friday.With the war raging in neighbouring Ukraine, Moldova has been facing inflation, high energy prices, a refugee influx and Russian aggression.The news came just hours after Russian missiles flew over Moldovan airspace.Announcing her resignation on Friday, Ms Gavrilita said that when her government was elected in 2021, no one expected it would have to manage ""so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine"".Moldova is precariously close to the war - it shares a 1,222km (759 mile) border with Ukraine, and has suffered greatly from the fallout of Russia's invasion.""I took over the government with an anti-corruption, pro-development and pro-European mandate at a time when corruption schemes had captured all the institutions and the oligarchs felt untouchable,"" Ms Gavrilita said at a news conference. ""We were immediately faced with energy blackmail, and those who did this hoped that we would give in,"" she said, referring to the Kremlin. An energy crisis was sparked last year when Russia suddenly reduced its gas supplies to Moldova, which relied 100% on Russia for gas. It caused inflation to skyrocket and there was public unrest over the high energy costs.President Maia Sandu thanked Ms Gavrilita for her ""enormous sacrifice and efforts to lead the country in a time of so many crises"".""We have stability, peace and development, where others wanted war and bankruptcy,"" the president said.She has already nominated her former defence adviser Dorin Recean - who is also pro-EU - as the next prime minister. The Moldovan parliament will vote to confirm his nomination next week.In the earlier days of the war in Ukraine, there were fears the conflict would spill over into Moldova, or that Russia might invade it too.That concern has receded for now, but as Moldova moves ever closer to joining the European Union, pressure has increased from Russia - which has tried to undermine the former Soviet state, and the EU's influence.In a stark warning on Thursday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia had a plan to ""destroy"" Moldova, according to Ukrainian intelligence.""These documents show who, when and how Russia is going to break democracy of Moldova and establish control,"" he told EU leaders at a summit in Brussels.""I immediately warned Moldova about these threats,"" he added.Moldovan intelligence services later confirmed they had also identified ""subversive activities"" aimed at ""undermining the state of the Republic of Moldova, destabilizing and violating public order.""There are also renewed tensions in Transnistria, a breakaway territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists that runs along Moldova's border with Ukraine, and where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed.Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of trying to turn Moldova against Russia - as he claimed it had already done with Ukraine.Natalia Gavrilita became prime minister in August 2021 when President Sandu's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) won a landslide parliamentary election.She previously served as finance minister from June 2019 to November 2019 in when Ms Sandu was prime minister.Moldova country profileRussian missile attack on Ukraine crosses MoldovaEU awards Ukraine and Moldova candidate status"
47,Canada appeals ruling to repatriate citizens in Syria,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64605783,"Canada has appealed a court decision that ordered it to repatriate four men imprisoned in Islamic State camps in Syria.It is also reportedly asking women held in the camps to relinquish custody of their Canadian children in order for the minors to be repatriated.The mothers are not Canadian nationals, but the children have citizenship because their fathers are.Human rights campaigners have pushed the country to repatriate its citizens.In January, Canada agreed to bring back six women and 13 children, but pushed back on repatriating the four men, arguing it had no obligation to provide support or bring back citizens from Syria because it had closed its embassy there in 2012.But a recent federal court ruling ordered the government to repatriate the men, who have not been formally charged with crimes. British-Canadian dual national, Jack Letts, whose British citizenship was revoked, is one of the four.In the appeal filed on Friday, Canada challenged that ruling, which concluded the country had violated the men's constitutional rights.Canada asked that the court order be stayed pending the appeal's outcome.The repatriation of the four men, as well as the women and children, would be the largest so far for Canada after the so-called Islamic State caliphate was destroyed in 2019.In a separate case, some women living in camps in north-east Syria say they have been told their children can only come to Canada without them. In correspondence seen by the BBC, Canada's foreign ministry contacted one of the mothers in November, saying in a letter that it would review whether her children are eligible to be brought to Canada given ""deteriorating conditions"" in the camps. The letter says the country's policy for repatriation ""only applies to Canadians"". The mothers were contacted by the government again on 26 January, said Prof Alexandra Bain, the director of the Canada-based Families Against Violent Extremism non-profit organisation.Prof Bain, who has been in contact with a number of Canadians detained in the camps, said the women told her they had been asked to consider sending their children to Canada alone.The women said they were given a deadline of a week-and-a-half to make the decision. She is aware of four foreign mothers who have 10 children in total, most under the age of seven. The fathers are either dead or imprisoned, she said.""Most of these children are very young, and some are even born in the camp,"" Prof Bain said, calling it inhumane for Canada to request that the families be separated. The deadline given to the mothers has since passed, and the women remain in the camps with their children. This video can not be playedSpeaking to the BBC's Quentin Sommerville, Jack Letts said he had been an ""enemy of Britain""Lawyers representing them said the Canadian government has not made it clear on how their cases will be handled going forward.Faraz Bawa, a Calgary-based lawyer representing one of the women, said he and the other lawyers are now working on getting their clients temporary resident permits so they have permission to enter Canada.But Mr Bawa said it is not clear whether those applications would be accepted by immigration officials. Global Affairs, the foreign ministry, did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the BBC.Human rights groups like Reprieve, a UK-based organisation that works with detainees in the Syrian camps, have criticised Canada's approach to the women's cases.Katherine Cornett, head of Reprieve's Syria and Iraq detention project, said it is ""cruel"" for the country to consider separating the children from their caregivers. ""This isn't a managed process where social services are involved, and the best interest of the child will be kept in mind,"" Ms Cornett said. ""They may never have contact with their parents whatsoever again after that."" She said the poor conditions inside the camp make this an exceptionally difficult choice for the mothers.Ms Cornett said that more than half of foreign nationals living in the camps are children, who are ""being held there as a form of collective punishment"". Adults in the camp, she said, are not given access to legal representation or a fair judicial process.Other countries have moved to repatriate entire family units with mixed nationalities, Ms Cornett said, including France and Germany. The US, Spain and the Netherlands have also repatriated their citizens from Syria.The UK, meanwhile, has stripped citizenship from people who travelled to fight for the so-called Islamic State. It took back two nationals last year after they were reportedly identified as human trafficking victims. Canada repatriated two women and children from Syria in October. One woman was arrested on terrorism charges and has been released on bail, while the other was released on a peace bond.IS recruit Jack Letts loses UK citizenshipCanada to take back 23 citizens from IS campsShamima Begum accepts she joined a terror group'I didn't join IS.

48,The children whose names were erased by the earthquake,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64604238,"The wounded children in Adana City Hospital are too young to know how much they've lost. I watched doctors in the intensive care unit bottle-feed an injured six-month-old girl whose parents can't be found. There are hundreds more cases of unidentified children whose parents are dead or untraceable. The earthquake broke their homes and now it has taken away their names. Dr Nursah Keskin grips the hand of the baby girl in intensive care - known only by the tag on her bed: ""Anonymous"".She has multiple fractures, a black eye and her face is badly bruised; but she turns and smiles at us. ""We know where she was found and how she got here. But we're trying to find an address. The search is continuing,"" says Dr Keskin, a paediatrician and deputy director at the hospital.Many of these cases are children rescued from collapsed buildings in other regions. They were brought to Adana because the hospital is still standing. Many other medical centres in the disaster zone have fallen or are damaged. Adana became a rescue hub. In one transfer, newborn babies were rushed here from a maternity ward in a badly-hit hospital in the city of Iskenderun.Turkish health officials say across the country's disaster zone there are currently more than 260 wounded children who they have not been able to identify.That figure may rise significantly as more areas are reached and the scale of homelessness fully emerges. I follow Dr Keskin through the packed corridors. Earthquake survivors lie on trolleys, others are wrapped in blankets on mattresses in an emergency area. We head towards the surgery ward, also filled with injured children. We meet a girl the doctors say is five or six years old. She's sleeping and hooked up to intravenous drips. The staff say she has a head trauma and multiple fractures.I ask if she has been able to tell them her name.""No, it's only eye-contact and gestures,"" says Dr Ilknur Banlicesur, a paediatric surgeon.""Because of the shock, these children cannot really talk. They know their names. Once they're stabilised a couple of days later we can [try to] talk,"" she explains.Health officials have been trying to match unidentified children to addresses. But often the addresses are nothing more than ruins. In at least 100 cases, nameless children have already been taken into care. Turkish social media has been filled with posts showing missing children, giving details of which floor they lived on in collapsed buildings, expressing hope they may have been rescued and taken to hospital.Surviving relatives and health ministry officials have been travelling between medical centres trying to find them. In the Adana hospital, the wounded keep coming. They are shocked and exhausted.Everyone here is a survivor, patients and medics alike.Dr Keskin lost relatives to the earthquake and sheltered in the hospital with her children as aftershocks struck.I ask her how she is coping.""I'm good, I'm trying to be good, because [the children] really need us. ""But I say thank God, I still have my children. I can't think of a bigger pain for a mother than losing her child.""Next to us, young patients in wards wait for their parents to come back.Some have been reunited.

But it was split in three as part of the cabinet reshuffle earlier this week: Business and Trade, Energy Security and Net Zero and Science, Innovation and Technology, which Ms Donelan now leads.She told BBC News that the reorganisation showed that science and innovation was ''at the heart'' of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's agenda.""It's a top priority for the prime minister because he understands how much innovation, growth and opportunity are at the heart of his promises that he made to the public.""Having this department with its relentless focus will ensure that technology innovation are making people's lives better.""Ms Donelan that she would bring together the government's scientific initiatives, some of which are dispersed across different departments, under one roof. This would enable her new department to ensure that publicly funded research helped deliver high-quality jobs and a better health service, as well as making the UK a leader in technology and innovation.Prof Dame Ottoline Leyser, who is the chief executive of the government agency that oversees funding of research, UKRI,  welcomed the appointment:""The establishment of the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is an incredibly exciting development, signalling the Government's commitment to building a fully joined up research and innovation system"".But Prof James Wilsdon, a specialist in science policy at University College London said that it was an ''odd time'' to make such a big change to how research is run in the UK.""We may be at the beginning of a golden era under Rishi Sunak as PM that will take us well into the 2050s, but most people think he'll be out by the end of next year,'' he said. ""If that's the case, then tinkering with the furniture, name badges and structures is really a distraction from the actual priorities.""There are many more pressing issues facing UK science than who is in charge of it, in which office in Whitehall.""Among those pressing issues is UK membership of the European Union's ¬£90bn Horizon research programme. The EU has gone back on a commitment it made in the Brexit withdrawal agreement to allow British scientists to participate because of a dispute over the status of Northern Ireland .Prof Sir Adrian Smith, who is the president of the Royal Society, which represents the UK's leading scientists, said that the issue had to be at the top of the new science secretary's to-do list. He said Ms Donelan's first job should be to secure association to Horizon Europe and other EU science programmes.''These schemes support outstanding international collaboration and without being part of them we are undermining the Prime Minister's stated ambition for the UK to be at the forefront of science and technology globally.""Follow Pallab on Twitter"

I've got to score runs and be successful at number three,"" Pope told BBC Sport.""I'll keep developing my cricket brain, so if the opportunity does arise I'll be as well equipped as I can be.""Surrey's Pope took charge of the England team for a match against England Lions before the 3-0 series win in Pakistan, and did the same again in Hamilton in a two-day match against a New Zealand XI that has served as preparation for two Tests against New Zealand. He was also on standby to lead the team in Rawalpindi in December when illness hit the England camp before the first Test against Pakistan and Stokes was one of the players affected.England have not named an official vice-captain to Stokes and Pope says there is no ""label"" on his increased exposure to a leadership role.""There's no vice-captain, there are a lot of leaders within the changing room,"" said Pope. ""If Stokesy wants to bounce ideas off me during a game, I'm more than happy to use my knowledge.""It [the captaincy] might be an option they are looking at in the future. It's just good to be seen as a leader in that changing room.""Pope, who has played 33 Tests since making his debut as a 20-year-old in 2018, captained teams at junior level but has only skippered in one game of professional cricket - Surrey's high-scoring draw against Glamorgan in the County Championship at the end of the 2021 season.Despite that lack of leadership experience, pace bowler Stuart Broad has labelled Pope a ""future England captain"".""Popey is a great leader in the group,"" said Broad, who has played under six captains in his 159-Test career.""He's grown so much in the last year, in the way he operates, the confidence and responsibility he's been given. He speaks really well in the group and he's got a great cricket mind.""England's first Test against New Zealand, a day-night match in Mount Maunganui, begins on Thursday (01:00 GMT).The build-up could be disrupted by Cyclone Gabrielle, which is due to hit northern New Zealand in the coming days.However, Pope believes England have already done enough to be ready as they bid to to earn their first Test win in this country for 15 years.""We're all 100% ready,"" said Pope.

53,The game that almost 'killed' international rugby,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64584534,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Welsh RugbyWhen Finn Russell and Dan Biggar commence an inevitable kicking duel during Saturday's game, spectators would do well to remember how far the game has come.This weekend's Six Nations match marks the 60th anniversary of a game that holds a firm place in rugby infamy.The Murrayfield slugfest in 1963 is regarded as one of the dreariest matches ever played - and it changed the way the game was played forever.And one man was responsible for the 'spectacle' - Clive Rowlands.The Big Freeze of 1963 was among the harshest winters on record.Sporting fixtures across the country were cancelled, however the newly installed undersoil heating at Murrayfield and an army of volunteers with snow shovels ensured the February game between Scotland and Wales went ahead.However, many of the 60,000 who braved the bitter cold may have wished they had not.Wales won 6-0. Although at the time such a scoreline was commonplace, the aspect that had purists crying into their beer were the tactics employed that day by the visitors - tactics that yielded an astonishing 111 line-outs. The average for international rugby today is rarely more than 20.As Denis Busher of the Daily Herald wrote at the time: ""International rugby is in its death throes as a spectator sport. Wales won carrying 'modern' power rugby to its logical conclusion.""Wales' coach Warren Gatland will be familiar with the critique, but 60 years ago it was the wily Rowlands who opted for brawn over brains.The Wales scrum-half and captain spotted an opportunity with some bedtime reading the night before the match.According to the matchday programme, the rival sets of forwards were evenly matched in terms of size. Rowlands, however, suspected differently. After checking with a few of his forwards, who admitted to being a few pounds heavier than the official records, and given the conditions, Rowlands decided Wales would try to beat Scotland at their own game up front.At a time when there was no penalty for kicking the ball straight into touch, even outside the 25-yard line - now the 22m line - Rowlands set about hoofing the ball up field time, and time... and time again.The power of the Wales pack and the unrelenting barrage of kicks pinned Scotland back for all but the final moments of a game that also included more than 35 scrums.The Wales backs may have boasted speed and guile, but were reduced to spectators. It is said their supremely gifted outside-half David Watkins received just two passes from Rowlands all game.Wales centre Brian Davies, who was dropped for the next match, said: ""I touched the ball twice and could hardly feel my hands in the cold.""Wales won at Murrayfield for the first time in 10 years, thanks to a penalty from full-back Grahame Hodgson and a stunning drop goal from Rowlands - the only international points he scored.Rowlands was carried from the pitch on the shoulders of travelling fans and was unrepentant about his tactics.""It was not attractive and I felt sorry for the backs,"" he said after the match. ""But we were all out to win and we played to win. The pack did a great job.""I was never at any time tempted to open the game up and let my backs make the running. That's what Scotland were praying we'd do.""Supporters may have been jubilant, but there were serious misgivings over where the game was heading.In the Daily Express, Pat Marshall concluded: ""This was power-rugby, brutally bludgeoned up and down the touchlines by two brutish packs with kicking scrum-halves yapping at their heels. ""It has no part in the pattern of British rugby, where quickness of wit and fleetness of foot still counts for more than brawn supported by an educated boot. Rowlands won a tactical victory, but it was no victory for rugby.""Others followed suit and steadily the authorities were moved to adopt the 'Australian dispensation' and ban direct kicking to touch from outside the 25-yard line some years later.The irony is that the team that benefitted the most from the law changes was the great Wales team of the early 1970s - coached of course by Rowlands."
54,Preview: Ireland v France - Grand Slam decider?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64568362,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Rugby UnionSaturday's colossal match between the two highest-ranked sides in world rugby could well decide the final destination of the 2023 Six Nations trophy.Andy Farrell's world number one Ireland team are vying to set a national record of 13 successive home victories.Defending champions France are on a 14-game unbeaten run and have an excellent recent record against the Irish. They have won the past three matches between the sides and were the last side to win in Dublin in 2021.But Fabien Galthie's side conceded 18 penalties in a scrappy encounter with Italy last Sunday and needed a late try to secure a 29-24 victory in Rome.Ireland come into the game full of confidence after blitzing Wales 34-10 in Cardiff.Ireland have been forced into one change with Rob Herring replacing the injured Dan Sheehan at hooker. Fit-again Ronan Kelleher is named on the bench but props Tadhg Furlong and Cian Healy remain sidelined by injury.There had been speculation over Conor Murray's fitness but the Munster scrum-half is selected alongside skipper Johnny Sexton, who starts despite leaving the pitch with a dead leg last weekend.France have named an unchanged starting XV from the one that defeated Italy last Sunday. Galthie has made two changes among the replacements, with Francois Cros and Baptiste Couilloud coming in for Thomas Lavault and Nolann Le Garrec.Alastair Eykyn: ""The eyes of the rugby world fall on Dublin. The two top-ranked sides lock horns, knowing that victory could set them on the path to a Grand Slam. ""The only shame is that it falls so early, in round two of the Championship. It has the feel of a heavyweight title fight, deserving of box-office status and dramatic final-round billing. ""Ireland's in-form hooker Dan Sheehan recently joined Tadgh Furlong and Jamison Gibson-Park on the injury list, but Andy Farrell has built a depth and a belief that should allow them to weather these absences. ""France will attack with their powerful front five and look to bully their way to a platform for the fleet-footed wizards like Dupont and Penaud. Ireland will have to match that physicality, and hit the reigning champions with their dynamism and cohesion. Don't miss it.""Former Ireland international Shane Horgan on the BBC's Rugby Union Daily podcast: ""I think we are marginal favourites against France at home. I assume that the players are feeling comfortable, meanwhile the rest of us are super nervous and recognise that this French team are one in a million. The nerves are high but expectations are high too.""Herring is not Dan Sheehan. Dan Sheehan is a phenomenon around the park, he has footwork like a centre. Kelleher coming back onto the bench is a big plus for Ireland. The compound problem here is in that front row. You take Furlong out, he is properly world class. He plays the game almost like nobody else.""Ireland head coach Andy Farrell: ""France are a fantastic team. The backroom staff and players have really got something going. French rugby is buzzing at the moment.""We need to put in an 80-minute performance as breaking them down as a team is very tough.""This is the type of game everyone wants to be part of.

58,Five WSL talking points as Man Utd aim for top,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64596393,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Women's FootballIt is rare for goalless draws to be the most interesting results in football - yet two 0-0s in the Women's Super League last weekend could prove crucial this season.Manchester United were held by Everton, and Arsenal at West Ham, to leave Chelsea in the driving seat to retain their WSL title.In the relegation fight, Leicester remain rooted to the bottom, but Reading and Brighton continue to look nervously over their shoulders - and how much further will Tottenham fall?Here are five things to look forward to this weekend, in the final round of WSL matches until March...Having met in the League Cup on Wednesday, Manchester City and Arsenal face off again less than 72 hours later in a game that could be decisive for either's WSL title ambitions.They both sit five points behind leaders Chelsea - Arsenal with a game in hand - and Gunners boss Jonas Eidevall thinks they could use the 1-0 midweek win to their advantage, although it could all depend on which side recovers best.""It's going to be a good guessing game for them,"" he said after Wednesday's win at Meadow Park. ""But that's part of the reason also why it's important to have two different systems to make it harder for opponents to prepare for us. If we know how we can use it, then our opponents will never know for sure whether we're using one or the other. That of course makes their preparation much harder.""Mostly it's what the players do on an individual basis to recover, who's the best at sleeping or taking ice baths. You have to be a world champion in those things now for Thursday and Friday; that'll make the difference on Saturday.""Manchester City manager Gareth Taylor played down the significance of the game as a decider.He said: ""Both teams have good knowledge of each other. From kick-off, you will see them get into it straight away, knowing what they are up against.""When you play a team repeatedly it can be a good thing. You don't have to overthink it.""No one here needs telling about the importance, but we don't overegg it as must-win game. Performance levels are what we concentrate on. If we get those levels right, we can win.""There are only four WSL matches as it is not an official matchday, but a free weekend being used for rearranged fixtures, including some postponed in September following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.Among those is Brighton against Aston Villa, which was supposed to take place at Amex Stadium last year but will instead be played at Broadfield Stadium on Sunday, having drawn 1-1 at Walsall last week.Villa manager Carla Ward says she is pleased to be facing the same opponents back to back, saying last week's draw felt like a defeat after they made the bulk of chances.""I'm never a fan of it usually,"" she said of playing the same team in successive games. ""But this time I'm delighted as we got to pick bones out of it this week.""We dominated that game, got a good point, but we should have won. There were many areas I was not happy with, so it's up to the players to put the performance right.""Another game rearranged from September is Tottenham against Manchester United. Unlike Brighton, Spurs will still get their chance to play at the men's team's stadium.A crowd of more than 30,000 is expected at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and could challenge the record home attendance for Spurs Women - 38,262 for the north London derby in 2019.Having lost six WSL games in a row, Spurs manager Rehanne Skinner admits it will be tough ask against title-chasing United - but that a huge home crowd could be the boost they need.""Going into that stadium is such a fantastic atmosphere,"" she said. ""The fans are the 12th player. They give you that boost and it's just such a great place to play. It gives us that elevated lift that we need whenever we go there. We really want to put on a good performance for the fans.""Liverpool took a vital step in their bid to avoid an immediate return to the Championship by beating Reading last Sunday, and a win over Leicester this weekend would all but ensure another season of WSL football.Essential for the push into mid-table will be Missy Bo Kearns, after she scored the opener against Reading. She told BBC Sport this week that she is eyeing a place in the England squad for the World Cup in July.Liverpool boss Matt Beard says Kearns will be key to his side for the remainder of the campaign, as she continues to readjust to the WSL following last season's promotion.""She's got the world at her feet, she's a very talented player,"" he said. ""The transition from Championship to WSL is tough. You're up against some of the world's best - so the first part of the season was a learning curve.""She's got more freedom now to get forward; you can see that now, that creativity and spark. Now she's adding assists and goals. For an attacking midfielder, she will be judged on that.""With Chelsea not in action this weekend, Manchester United can go top if they win at Tottenham.Marc Skinner's side have never won the WSL, but with Chelsea set for an extended period away from league football after reaching the League Cup final, his side have a chance to build momentum.Skinner told his press conference on Wednesday: ""We go into every game to try and win. I genuinely can't get this group to think of anything other than winning.""His side conceded ground to Chelsea last weekend, failing to turn dominance into goals in a 0-0 draw with Everton.""We will take nothing for granted and look to convert chances this time,"" he added."

60,VAR did not draw guide lines for Brentford leveller,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64616645,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section ArsenalReferees' body PGMOL says ""human error"" was to blame for incorrect VAR decisions in games on Saturday.PGMOL chief Howard Webb has contacted Arsenal and Brighton to ""acknowledge and explain the significant errors"" that occurred in their games.VAR operator Lee Mason did not draw the guidelines to check for offside on Brentford's equaliser against Arsenal.Brighton had a goal disallowed for offside against Crystal Palace after the VAR guidelines were wrongly drawn.During the 1-1 draw at Emirates Stadium, Ivan Toney's 74th-minute goal was the subject of a VAR check by Mason following Ethan Pinnock's challenge on Gabriel.That incident was cleared but there was a suggestion Christian Norgaard was offside in the goal's build-up.However, Mason did not use the system's lines that would have shown whether the Brentford man was offside or not.In the 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park, Pervis Estupinan's strike on 32 minutes was disallowed after a VAR review deemed the Ecuadorian to be offside.However, the offside line was wrongly drawn from James Tomkins rather than his fellow Palace defender Marc Guehi, who was standing just behind him and would have played Estupinan onside.There was more VAR controversy elsewhere on Saturday when Chelsea were denied a late penalty against West Ham, despite Tomas Soucek appearing to block Conor Gallagher's shot with his arm.The incident was checked but no further action taken.The decisions made for an uncomfortable day for Webb, who has pledged to drive up standards in the top flight.Webb's early weeks in the job have been regarded as positive. However, for Mason, a dedicated VAR official, to be involved in one of two key mistakes on one day, creates a difficult situation for Webb to deal with.""Both incidents, which were due to human error and related to the analysis of offside situations, are being thoroughly reviewed by PGMOL,"" said a statement from the body.A Brighton spokesperson said the club ""while hugely disappointed by the error, has accepted PGMOL's apology"".Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta accused officials of ""changing the rules"", while former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy called it a ""horrendous decision"".""I just looked back and it is offside, yes,"" Arteta said after the match.""You have to apply certain principles in defending and you do that by sticking to the rules. Suddenly you change the rules and then you have to change your principles."""

India captain Rohit Sharma, whose 120 helped set up the win, said: ""When playing a series like this, it's important to start well. I'm happy I could put up a performance which could help the team.""The second Test begins on Friday, 17 February, in New Delhi."

73,Thunder begin title defence with win on opening day,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/netball/64609672,"Last updated on 13 February 202313 February 2023.From the section NetballManchester Thunder got their title defence off to a winning start with victory over Celtic Dragons at the Netball Super League season opener in Nottingham.The four-time champions comfortably beat the Welsh outfit 68-42.Loughborough Lightning kicked off the bumper day with a ruthless 86-52 victory over Team Bath in front of a packed crowd.There were also wins for Surrey Storm, Severn Stars and London Pulse. Light shows, dance performances between matches and a DJ all contributed to the party atmosphere as the sport gears up for an important year, with the World Cup taking place in July in South Africa.It was a race to the finish between Thunder and Lightning last season and this year has started in much the same vein, as both sides put down marker performances and immediately occupy the top two league positions.Thunder's squad may look different to last season's unbeaten title-winning one, but the strength of the Manchester club's pathway is so prolific that many of the players in their current line-up are simply returning to the club they developed at.After a cagey opening quarter Thunder pulled away in the second period, scoring 20 goals and suppressing Dragons to just 10, clicking into their rhythm to take a routine win.""We grew into the game,"" said captain Natalie Metcalf. ""It's going to be sloppy at times but it's about how we fix it on court.""I do think this is going to be the most competitive Super League season we've seen. Everyone says it every year but I genuinely believe it's true this time.""Meanwhile, beaten finalists last season Lightning performed much like a side who have managed to retain their core group of players, showcasing their experience to pick up where they left off, while Bath are a side who are still building with new faces and a change of coach.A blistering third quarter where Lightning scored 24 goals to Bath's seven put the 2021 champions out of sight and they went on to record their highest ever goal tally in a Super League match.""It's about pushing on and making sure we've got a target of how many goals we want per quarter this year and keeping up that intensity,"" said Lightning captain Natalie Panagarry.""It's familiar for us, a lot of us have played together for a long period so we should take advantage of that against teams who might be taking a while to build.""With so much player and coach movement in the close season the opening day provided the perfect opportunity for teams to suss each other out and gauge what they will be coming up against in the coming months.In what was perhaps the most surprising result of the day, Stars, who only won three matches all season in 2022, beat two-time champions Saracens Mavericks 59-55 in a fascinating contest.The two sides have undergone immense changes since last season - both have new coaches and Stars have a new-look side with only two players keeping their position in the squad for 2023.Roared on by a crowd clearly impressed with the revitalised team, Stars stretched a narrow lead in the third quarter and held on to take a statement victory.""When you have a new team you can start overthinking but we've worked on keeping it simple, basic netball, slowing the pace and being clinical,"" said player-coach Jo Trip.""Our training before this game was so good I knew we were ready.""Storm, who had an inconsistent season last year but have strengthened in the close season, ran out 68-56 winners over Strathclyde Sirens.Sirens closed the gap to nine goals in the second quarter but a dominant second half showcased Storm's dangerous attacking line-up of Proscovia Peace and England Rose Sophie Drakeford-Lewis.Later, London Pulse came from behind to beat Leeds Rhinos 64-48 as head coach Sam Bird rotated all 12 of her exciting squad on court, including England duo Jade Clarke and Chelsea Pitman, who joined this season.Rhinos, without some key players, showed promising signs to stay in the game but, having lost the second quarter 22-10, gave themselves too much to do in the final period.On Monday, the Storm made it back-to-back wins with a 76-51 victory over the Stars.Team Bath 52-86 Loughborough LightningSurrey Storm 68-56 Strathclyde SirensSaracens Mavericks 55-59 Severn StarsLeeds Rhinos 48-64 London PulseManchester Thunder 68-42 Celtic Dragons"

78,Superb Ireland earn thrilling bonus-point win over France,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64610568,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Irish Rugbycomments1011Ireland boosted their Six Nations title hopes and ended France's run of 14 straight wins as they battled to a pulsating bonus-point win in Dublin. Ireland scored three first-half tries with Hugo Keenan, James Lowe and Andrew Porter all crossing. Damian Penaud's brilliant counter-attacking try and three Thomas Ramos penalties kept France in touch. Ramos cancelled out Ross Byrne's penalty with a drop-goal, but Garry Ringrose's try secured Ireland's win. The victory further underlines Ireland's status as the world's number one side and gives Andy Farrell's side a national record 13th straight home win, while ending France's dream of a second successive Grand Slam. Having taken bonus-point wins over Wales and France, Ireland will next face Italy in Rome on 25 February with France hosting Scotland a day later.Saturday's match had been billed as a titanic showdown between the championship favourites and it comfortably met the hype as the world's top two sides produced an electrifying first-half spectacle. While France took an early lead through Ramos' fifth-minute penalty, Ireland immediately set about regaining control and, while Andrew Porter was denied a try in the hosts' opening attack, Finlay Bealham's sleight of hand sent Keenan scything through before crashing over for a well-worked score. However, after a second Ramos penalty cut Ireland's lead to a single point, France ruthlessly exploited space in the home side's defence when Anthony Jelonch rampaged through Irish bodies and fed Penaud, who sprinted clear to finish off a stunning counter.With most of the stadium still marvelling at Penaud's score, Ireland worked the ball out to Lowe who, despite Penaud's attempts to push him into touch, acrobatically managed to touch the ball down in the corner, with the try standing following a lengthy TMO review. Sexton's failed conversion attempt meant Ireland trailed 13-12, but after Uini Atonio was yellow-carded for a high hit on Rob Herring, Porter marked his 50th cap by scoring Ireland's third try before Sexton's penalty put the hosts six points clear at the end of a breathless opening 40 minutes.Following a thunderous first half, excitement turned to tension after the restart as the intensity dropped and France set about narrowing the deficit. However, they failed to make inroads as Ramos missed a long-range kick at the posts before Stuart McCloskey eased the mounting pressure on the Irish defence by forcing a turnover close to the try-line.After Ireland captain Johnny Sexton was forced off, his replacement Byrne's penalty split the posts to put Ireland nine clear before Ramos moved France to within six with a classy drop-goal. While that put France within a converted try of victory, the away side's hopes of snatching a late victory were dashed when Ringrose somehow slipped past three French tacklers and touched down to give Ireland the bonus-point win after a championship encounter that will live long in the memory. Having been comfortably beaten in Paris last year, Farrell had urged his side to ""take our game to them"" and the players rose to the task with a performance that showcased Ireland's courage, skill and championship credentials. It also completes the set for Farrell with the Englishman now having beaten all tier one nations during his three-and-a-half-year spell in charge of Ireland, after wins over southern hemisphere giants New Zealand, South Africa and Australia during a memorable 2022. Farrell had lost all three previous meetings with France but Saturday's win will give Ireland the psychological advantage before a possible World Cup quarter-final meeting on French soil later this year. That is further down the line, though. As for now, Ireland have kept alive their hopes of winning the Grand Slam for the fourth time in their history and will be considered heavy favourites to win a first title since 2018 as they prepare for matches in Italy and Scotland, before hosting England on 18 March. It was another titanic display from Ireland number eight Caelan Doris, whose influence on Andy Farrell's team appears to be growing on a weekly basis. Former Ireland head coach Eddie O'Sullivan on BBC Radio Ulster: ""That was a world-class performance from Ireland. When you are number one in the world the expectation is to deliver a world-class performance and that was that. The number two side in the world couldn't break Ireland down there at times and gave up.""Thomas Ramos going for the drop-kick was the white flag to say they weren't going to break Ireland down. Tactically Ireland were superb, especially in the final quarter.""Former Ireland flanker Chris Henry on BBC Radio Ulster: ""Realistically, if this isn't for a Grand Slam now it is a failure. They need to go on and win this outright. They have the team on form to do this.""Ireland: Keenan; Hansen, Ringrose, McCloskey, Lowe; Sexton, Murray; Porter, Herring, Bealham, Beirne, Ryan, O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Doris.Replacements: Kelleher, Kilcoyne, O'Toole, Henderson, Conan, Casey, Byrne, Aki.France: Ramos; Penaud, Fickou, Moefana, Dumortier; Ntamack, Dupont; Baille, Marchand, Atonio, Flament, Willemse, Jelonch, Ollivon, Alldritt.Replacements: Barlot, Wardi, Falatea, Taofifenua, Cros, Macalou, Couilloud, Jalibert.Referee: Wayne Barnes (RFU)Assistant referees: Matthew Carley (RFU) and Jordan Way (RA)TMO: Brendon Pickerill (NZR)These comments are now closed."

80,Tests don't need 'gimmick' day-nighters - Robinson,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64616001,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Cricketcomments225England pace bowler Ollie Robinson says Test cricket does not need ""gimmicky"" day-night matches.England's first Test in a two-match series against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui on Thursday (01:00 GMT) is a day-nighter, played under floodlights with a pink ball.""There's nothing wrong with Test cricket to start with,"" said Robinson. ""I'm not a massive fan of the pink ball. I don't think we need to play these pink-ball games.""Day-night matches are common in limited-overs cricket and were introduced to the longest form of the game with the aim of raising the profile of Test cricket, both by increasing attendances and TV audiences.There have been 20 day-night men's Tests since the first in 2015, played in seven different countries by 10 different teams.They have proved popular in Australia, where 11 day-nighters have taken place, all won by the home side, including two in the Ashes series of 2021-22. There have also been three women's day-night Tests in Australia.England's men have played six day-nighters and have won just one - their first and the only one they have played at home - against West Indies in 2017. In the only day-night Test they have played in New Zealand, in 2018, they were bowled out for 58 as part of defeat by an innings.And Robinson, 29, believes England's enterprising style of cricket that has seen them win nine of their past 10 matches is enough to attract supporters to the Test format.""It is bit gimmicky. They're trying to get crowds and change the game a little bit but the way England are playing Test cricket at the moment, I don't think that needs to happen,"" said Robinson. ""We could stick to how we're going and we're entertaining people as we are, so I'm not sure if it's necessary.""England travelled to Mount Maunganui on Sunday, just before ex-cyclone Gabrielle is due to hit the Bay of Plenty, where the beach-side town is situated.With heavy rain and strong winds set to lash the area in the coming days, preparations for the Test could be seriously affected. Even though the Bay Oval has grass nets that are under cover, England are unlikely to practice on Monday.""We are well aware it could be tricky to get out there,"" said Robinson, who has taken 60 wickets in 14 Tests. ""If we don't train before Thursday I feel we've had good preparation and we're ready to go.""With England attempting to regain the Ashes this summer, Robinson could line up alongside Steve Smith in the County Championship after the Australia batter's agreement to join Sussex for three matches in May.Robinson came up against Smith down under a year ago and says he sees the former Australia captain's arrival as an opportunity to learn, rather than a risk.""People know how I bowl and what I do, so hopefully I can just use it to my advantage,"" said Robinson. ""He changed his technique quite a lot, so any sort of hints or points I can get from him could be valuable to us.""I'm excited at the opportunity to play with him. Hopefully I can learn a bit more about him. ""I found him awkward to bowl at at times, so it'd be good to watch him a bit closer and see if I can learn any more about his batting and ways to get him out.""These comments are now closed."

84,What to look out for in the Scottish Cup last 16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64574680,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Scottish CupThe Scottish Cup reaches the last 16 stage after the previous round delivered one of the tournament's biggest ever shocks.Here, BBC Scotland picks out what to look out for in the fifth round, including another potential upset, whether Darvel can repeat their heroics, and some all top-flight ties.Let's start with the classic football oxymoron; the likely upset... Caley Thistle were beaten 2-0 at home by Queen's Park, only to get called back after it turned out their opponents had fielded an ineligible loan player. That reprieve, along with their recent record in West Lothian, has all the makings of a good cup yarn.However, Livingston are ticking along nicely and it's Motherwell who look the most vulnerable of top-flight sides, given their wretched form.The Steelmen have not won a league match since the end of October and have lost three on the spin since overcoming Arbroath at Gayfield in the fourth round of this tournament.Steven Hammell's men may be glad to be on the road again since they were booed off after losing to St Johnstone, who have now won more league matches at Fir Park this season (err... two) than the home team has.Motherwell may have seen off Arbroath without too much fuss but Raith Rovers are now 11 games unbeaten in all competitions after seeing off Dundee on penalties to reach the Challenge Cup final.Sixth-tier side Darvel were the sensation of the last round as they beat Aberdeen in one of the biggest shocks in the 149-year history of the competition.The Ayrshire side were rewarded with another home tie against League One Falkirk in the last 16, a game which they will relish.John McGlynn's Falkirk will be equally confident, though, as they sit second in the third tier on an unbeaten run of eight games, with seven of those wins.A team from a small Ayrshire village in the quarter-finals would have been unthinkable at the start of the competition, but it is a distinct possibility.You can see whether Mick Kennedy's heroes manage it again at Recreation Park live on BBC Scotland from 19:30 GMT on Monday.There are two all-Premiership ties to get stuck into. Firstly, Dundee United meet relegation rivals Kilmarnock on Saturday for the second time in a fortnight and the fifth time overall this season, having also played in the League Cup.Three of the four meetings have taken place at Rugby Park, with Kilmarnock winning two and drawing one of those, but United won the only meeting at Tannadice, 4-0 in November.The result is unlikely to have a big bearing on the relegation battle, but it could certainly affect the mood around both clubs for the run-in.Elsewhere, Celtic face the only side to beat them domestically, St Mirren. However, the game is at Celtic Park where the 40-time winners hammered Stephen Robinson's side 4-0 last time and where they are unbeaten in 42 domestic games.Most would back Ange Postecoglou's side to maintain their 100% home record in Scotland this season, but St Mirren were the last side to win at Parkhead two years ago, and every record has to end some time.Finally, a trio of Championship sides - Partick Thistle, Hamilton Accies, and Inverness CT - will aim to knock out the sides sitting second, third, and fourth in the Premiership in Rangers, Hearts, and Livingston.League Two Elgin travel to meet second-tier high flyers Ayr United, aiming to reach the quarter-finals for just the second time in their history.""Knowing [Ayr boss] Lee Bullen I am very sure he won't underestimate us,"" Elgin boss Gavin Price said. ""I'm sure they're quite happy with the draw, it gives them a good opportunity to progress but it is an opportunity for us also and we have got to grasp that.""How about the cup holders? Well, Rangers are certainly enjoying life under Michael Beale, who has yet to lose a game since taking over from Giovanni van Bronckhorst in December.However, that run of 11 wins and one draw has not been enough to put any kind of dent in Celtic's Premiership lead as the big two steamroller the rest, so the cups look Beale's best bet for success this term.Following the early season upheaval of a long injury list and demoralising Champions League defeats, there is a settled back four at Ibrox now and healthy competition for midfield places.It's been a streaky season for Partick Thistle, who recovered from a horrible run of five defeats in a row to claw themselves back into the promotion race, only to lose their past two at home to teams at the wrong end of the table. But that's just the kind of thing that goes on in the twilight zone of the world's toughest division to predict.Thistle have not been to Ibrox since 2017 and have not won there since 1981.They did give Rangers a fright on their last Scottish Cup visit in 2008, when Damon Gray gave them a 1-0 lead midway through the second half, only for Kris Boyd to hit back straight away to earn a replay, which went the way of the team in blue.Talking of replays, now a thing of the past, did you know Thistle played 11 games on their way to their one and only Scottish Cup triumph in 1921? They played three times against Hibs, Motherwell and Hearts before needing just one go to beat Rangers in the final.All ties at 15:00 on Saturday unless otherwise statedHamilton Academical v Hearts (Friday, 19:45)Raith Rovers v MotherwellLivingston v Inverness CTDundee United v KilmarnockAyr United v Elgin CityCeltic v St Mirren (Saturday, 17:30)Rangers v Partick Thistle (Sunday, 16:00)Darvel v Falkirk (Monday, 19:45)"
85,Positive England aim to inspire at T20 World Cup,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64593951,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section CricketDespite the stitches in her lip after being hit by the ball during a warm-up match against South Africa, Heather Knight is in good spirits before her side's first outing at the Women's T20 World Cup. Overlooking the vast mountains in the heat of Stellenbosch where the teams are based, England are enjoying some downtime before their campaign begins against West Indies on 11 February.The skipper is calm but positive - which seems to be a buzzword for the brand of cricket she wants her side to play under new coach Jon Lewis.""I'd say it's the best vibe I've felt from a group going into a World Cup before,"" Knight, who is part of a World Cup squad for the 10th time, told BBC Sport. ""We're really clear on how we want to do things, and the warm-ups have been a real success in that regard. ""Now, it's just about taking that mentality under pressure into the big games, and replicate that again to go out and do our thing."" The side have things to put right from the previous T20 World Cup, too. England lost their first group-stage game to South Africa, which cost them down the line when their semi-final against India was washed out. With no reserve days, India automatically went through after topping their group, when England were second. ""I've learned you need to start fast in T20 World Cups,"" said Knight, 32. ""If you slip up early it can cost you, and the games come at you thick and fast. In T20, anyone can beat anyone so you have to start well."" But the mood around the team is positive and relaxed, with England enjoying the benefits of a fresh coach and an injection of youth in the side with the likes of Alice Capsey and Lauren Bell supporting the experience of Knight, Nat and Katherine Sciver-Brunt and Danni Wyatt. ""The women's game is changing all the time and we want to be ahead of the curve with that,"" added Knight. ""Jon has given us real clarity and positivity. He wants us to inspire and to entertain, and we're looking forward to taking teams on more than we have previously."" Despite the attention and magnitude of a World Cup, another cricketing event is lurking - not even in the background, but right in the middle of it. The auction for the Women's Premier League, a women's edition of the world's biggest Twenty20 franchise competition, the Indian Premier League, takes place on Monday, 13 February.It is set to be a game-changing moment for women's cricket, and all England's players have put their names into the draft. As a result, there has been plenty of debate and discussion around who will be picked up, and for how much. ""Talking about it is completely fine, we do talk about it as a group,"" said Knight. ""It's going to be a bit of a distraction, that's a given - it will be for the other teams, too.""But people will deal with it in different ways. It's just about discussing how it might affect you as an individual and working through that whether it's positive or negative, if you get picked up or you don't.""It might put added pressure if someone gets picked up at a high price, for example, so we've just got to keep talking about it and I've got to keep everyone focused on what we are here to do.""Fast bowler Katherine Sciver-Brunt was part of the side that won the inaugural women's T20 World Cup in 2009, the first and last time England won the title. Sciver-Brunt, 37, has faced injury setbacks in the latter stages of her career and discussions around her retirement have lingered each time, but she says Lewis' appointment as head coach and the development of the women's game has sparked more desire to continue. ""If I stop now I'd be happy, but lots of things happen in short spaces of time,"" she said.""Jon Lewis coming in has just reignited some stuff and the environment's amazing.""Sciver-Brunt received one of England's first central contracts in 2014 but since then, the domestic game has developed its professionalism and with the emergence of The Hundred, young players have increased opportunities in the sport. ""I can see the future these girls have got and I'm jealous, I'm not going to lie!"" she said. ""The things that are happening are extremely positive."" And in terms of her future, that positivity and opportunity has presented a bit more of a dilemma.""Where I was clear [about my future] five months ago, I'm now unclear,"" Sciver-Brunt added. ""If we won the World Cup that could be a really good time to stop and five months ago I had promised everyone that's what I would do.""But if we don't win, then the Ashes are two seconds away. I would still be bowling and still be fit. It's not something I can say 'no' to just yet."""

""We have felt, and continue to feel, the financial impact of supporting player purchases which have not worked out as planned.""Tottenham, who are  fifth in the Premier League, have only won one major trophy, the 2007-08 League Cup, since Levy became chairman of the club in 2001.He said: ""We share our supporters' frustrations at so many 'near misses' resulting in a lack of trophies.""Over the last two decades we have been in 14 semi-finals, made it to six finals and only won one of them. It must be our hope that we are soon celebrating a trophy win.""Tottenham were recently listed ninth in Deloitte's Money League study from the 2021-22 season, which ranks the world's richest clubs by revenue.In their new financial report, Spurs announced a 22.7% increase in revenue to ¬£444m for the year ending June 2022, up from ¬£361.9m in the previous 12 months.The club recorded a rise in match receipts from ¬£1.9m to ¬£106.1m in their first full season in the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.It was also the first complete season that full-capacity crowds were allowed back into football grounds after two seasons of disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which Tottenham say resulted in the loss of approximately ¬£200m in revenue. Commercial revenue grew by 20.7% to ¬£31.5m but they received less Uefa prize money following an early exit from the Europa Conference League - having reached the Europa League last 16 in 2020-21.Tottenham's finances were also boosted with majority shareholders ENIC Sports Inc agreeing in May to put an extra ¬£150m into the club."

90,'Forget bogeyman Gatland. This is Scotland's time',https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64591136,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Scottish RugbyThere can scarcely be a time when Warren Gatland has been more concerned about his perfect run against Scotland coming to an end. Eleven victories in a row is a statistic that fries the brain. No coach in history has won more games against the Scots than the redoubtable Kiwi. You'd bet the house that no coach in history ever will.Wales are in Edinburgh for Saturday's Six Nations Test and so, too, is that flaky old friend of Scotland fans - hope. Hope walks the streets, like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Hope says that Scotland with its playmakers and its ruthlessness and its belligerence and its squad depth have turned the corner and are ready to bring an end to this nonsense against Gatland's team. Hope says that Scotland's attack and defence are at such a joyously high level now that an uncertain Wales will be put away.  We know the thing about hope, though. Hope giveth and hope taketh away. In 2006, Scotland had hope of going two from two in the championship for the first time ever but Wales (and a Scott Murray red card) killed it stone dead. They had hope of going two for two again in 2021, but Wales (and a Zander Fagerson red card) removed it. In 2022, they packed up their hope and headed for Cardiff for another shot at two from two, but Wales (and a wounding Finn Russell yellow card) delivered another tale of woe.That game last year was rugby's equivalent of a slap across the face with a wet kipper. According to the movie website Rotten Tomatoes, the scariest thing that has ever appeared on a television screen is The Exorcist, which just goes to show you that the Rotten Tomatoes people scare pretty easily. In terms of true gore, nothing - and we mean nothing - in that film could hold a candle to Scotland's performance against Wales in Cardiff last year. Even now, a year on, it comes with a health warning. Scotland look to have moved on since then, but the memory is still there, lurking in the corner of the mind. Somebody bursting through a door with an axe has nothing on the brutality at the Principality last year, a championship that began, as this championship has, with a win against England before lurching into chaos and the sight of Scotland foostering their way through 20 pointless phases at the end of another coulda-shoulda day.   Contrast the Scottish plodders then and the Scottish thoroughbreds of last weekend at Twickenham. Four tries on the back of 29% territory. That speaks to the ruthless, almost freakish, efficiency of what they did with ball in hand. An average of 4.1 points scored for every visit to England's 22 in a sport where anything over three points per visit is deemed excellent. Last year, Scotland's return in their five games was 3.4, 1.8, 2.4, 3.7 and 0.6. More than 200 tackles made and yet only nine penalties given away, three below their game average from a year ago, which also happened to be the highest in the tournament. Establishing an aura takes a while. Ireland's is around a relentless and suffocating attack led by Johnny Sexton. France's aura is around their immense power and the sniping brilliance of Antoine Dupont. Wales used to have one typified by the mad intensity of Alun Wyn Jones and an attitude of never-say-die. Scotland have a bit to go - and many more games to win - before they carry that presence with them, but Twickenham was an illustration of what they are capable of, even off limited amounts of ball.  In just a few short months, there appears to have been seismic change in Gregor Townsend's team. They scored four blistering tries last weekend without the services of Darcy Graham, but had the excellent Kyle Steyn to fill in. They were missing two stellar opensides in Hamish Watson and Rory Darge and yet found a thumpingly good replacement in Luke Crosbie.Last season's Six Nations finished with Chris Harris and Sam Johnson in the midfield, now it's the lethal duo of Huw Jones and Sione Tuipulotu, a lovely combination of vision and explosiveness that offers a world of promise.Ali Price was the scrum-half then and is not even in the 23 now. There's a new centre partnership, a new scrum-half, a new lock (or newish given it's the reborn Richie Gray we're talking about), a new captain and a new open-side. Cohesion is the watchword in Test rugby these days. You'd expect Townsend to stick to as close to the same 15 and the same 23 as he can in the lead-up to the World Cup. None of Watson, Darge, Scott Cummings, Stuart McInally, Sam Skinner, Rory Sutherland, Zander Fagerson, Cam Redpath, Graham, Price or Johnson were in the 23 that beat England last Saturday. Fitness allowing, you could pick an entirely different 15 to the team that started at Twickenham and it would be more than decent. So this is Scotland's time. It has to be. A skilful attack that is capable of conjuring tries from anywhere on the pitch, a backline with playmakers, imagination, daring and ferociously dangerous runners. Scotland's forwards, skilful and thunderous, put in a monumental shift against England. They were still attacking and defending with gusto in the dying minutes. Matt Fagerson is the relatively unsung member of that group. Others got the limelight, but Fagerson's performance was astonishingly good, as complete a performance from a Scotland number eight in a generation. There are more reasons to believe this time than any other time on Townsend's watch, but it's still only one win. Nobody in Scotland with any grasp on two decades of history will be getting carried away just yet. It will mean precisely nothing if they don't make it two on Saturday.The Test will have had an added relevance for Stuart Hogg. If you count his two Tests for the Lions in the summer of 2021 - and why wouldn't you - Hogg will play his 100th international match on Saturday. The fact that it's Gatland's Wales he'll be playing it against only adds to the compelling nature of what's about to go down at Murrayfield.He made his debut against Gatland's Wales, had one of his worst rugby experiences against Gatland's Wales - a red card and a 50-point horseing in 2014 - and has lost more games to Gatland's Wales than anybody else in this Scotland squad. In their time, Ross Ford lost eight and John Barclay seven. Hogg doesn't want to advance another step towards that particular dungeon. The other week Barclay posed a simple but pertinent question on the BBC. Talking of Scotland's myriad strengths he wondered aloud about their prospects of achieving something in this Six Nations,. ""If not now, when?"" he asked.Yes. Townsend and his players are the only ones who can answer that, continuing on Saturday with the arrival of the bogeyman and his beleaguered army. "
91,Newcomer Sinclair ready to help Dragons grow,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/netball/64594513,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section NetballNew recruit Gabby Sinclair believes Celtic Dragons will see another season of growth as Netball Superleague 2023 gets underway on Saturday, 11 February.Goal attack Sinclair, 29, has joined the Welsh side from Super Netball team Collingwood Magpies in her native Australia.After just one win over the previous two seasons, Dragons won three games in 2022 and avoided another bottom finish.""It'll be really exciting to see how the season goes,"" said Sinclair.""Last year was a really big growth year for the Dragons. ""I think from the start of the season until the end of the season saw a massive improvement, towards the end of the season losing a few games by just a few goals.""So I think for us it's really about learning about how to win games and really push to get over the line.""I think we're in such a good spot at the start of the season with the growth that we've had to where we were at the start of last season, so I think it's really exciting we've got so much more growth and development in us.""Sinclair joins a Celtic Dragons side that features a large proportion of the Welsh Feathers national squad, with Chelsea Beard returning after playing for Team Bath and then spending time away from netball because of the birth of her two sons. They have also recruited defender Ally Housley and Ella Powell-Davies from Wasps.They have, however, lost Wales international Nia Jones to Superleague rivals Leeds Rhinos, Kat Short who has left to pursue her medical career and Lef√©bre Rademan who is taking a break after a knee injury. After four years playing in Australia's Suncorp Super Netball (SSN), Sinclair hopes she can help raise standards in Wales.""Personally, I'd like to bring a bit of my experience from playing SSN and help build our court craft and just support those around me to be their best and really see what we can achieve this year,""  the Australian told the BBC's Radio Wales Sport programme.""I guess in Australia SSN is probably a little bit more professional at this point than over here in the UK. ""There's more accessibility in regards to training ... which helps to bring up that standard. ""I think from learning the processes of that high performance environment I can help bring a little bit of that over to Celtic Dragons and really help drive those standards and implement things that maybe haven't been seen before.""Hopefully as time goes on it can become more professional over here and players won't have to work and have all those other commitments. In Australia we're lucky enough that we can play and have netball as our full time focus.""Hopefully netball in the UK is growing and hopefully it can get to where SSN is in a few years.""The 2023 10 team Netball Superleague gets underway this weekend with five matches back-to-back at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena.Celtic Dragons feature in the final game of the eight-hour Saturday netball feast, coming up against 2022 champions Manchester Thunder.""That will be a really big challenge,"" said Sinclair, ""but you know an awesome start and season opener for us. ""They've got some big names and I think with any team you're coming up against that's won the Premiership it's going to be a big battle. ""I think it'll be a highly contested game, it'll be a lot of hard work but we're really looking forward to it and can't wait to see what we can put out there. ""Training's been going really well, obviously discussed a few tactics that we want to put in play on the weekend.""It's been really good to be able to put those things that we've talked about in our classroom sessions and really practise that during court work and hopefully we can put that out there on Saturday.""Listen to the extended interview with Gabby Sinclair on Friday's Radio Wales Sport from 19:00 GMT on BBC Radio Wales and BBC Sounds, and on demand after transmission.Find out how to get into netball with the BBC Get Inspired guide"

McKibbin, 20, recorded five birdies and two bogeys to sit on 11 under alongside Chinese amateur Wenyi Ding, who had played 14 holes before play was halted.""I played very nicely most of the day, especially the front nine,"" said Northern Ireland's McKibbin.""A little bit colder on the back, overall a pretty good day.""The second round will resume at 00:15 GMT on Saturday morning. First-round leader McKibbin had played 17 holes when play was halted for an hour due to flooded greens. When play resumed, McKibbin closed out with a par before being joined on 11 under by 18-year-old Ding, who hit two eagles, two birdies and a bogey before fading light forced him off the course. McKibbin secured his full DP World Tour card by finishing in a share of sixth place at last November's Challenge Tour Grand Final in Majorca.He then achieved successive top-20 finishes in his first three events of this season which took place in South Africa in late November and December.McKibbin, who hails from the same Holywood Club as world number one Rory McIlroy, began 2023 by narrowly missing the cut at both the Abu Dhabi Championship and Dubai Desert Classic before finishing tied 36th at the Ras Al Khaimah Championship in the United Arab Emirates.England's Andy Sullivan and Germany's Marcel Schneider lie a shot off the lead following rounds of 65 and 67 respectively, with Sam Hutsby, Nathan Kimsey and Scott Jamieson all on nine under."
94,Dismiss me for my size at your peril - Volkanovski,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/mixed-martial-arts/64569130,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Mixed Martial ArtsWhen Alexander Volkanovski stands face-to-face with Islam Makhachev, he sees a familiar expression.Throughout his life, Volkanovski, 34, says he has been dismissed because of his height and he senses the same preconception when he looks lightweight champion Makhachev in the eyes.At 5ft 6in, Volkanovski is among the shorter fighters in the UFC, but size has never hindered the Australian - it has inspired him.Volkanovski is the featherweight champion and the number one ranked pound-for-pound fighter, and will look to make history on Saturday when he challenges Russia's Makhachev, 31, for the lightweight belt at UFC 284 in Perth, Australia.""I've always been undersized and always had people trying to push that narrative, but the amount of times I've embarrassed them,"" Volkanovski told BBC Sport.""I love when people put me as the underdog and think I'm undersized. You want to say that stuff? Cool. Just remember when I win, give me my flowers, you should reward me well when I get that job done.""I obviously [fight] for my family, my team and all that sort of stuff which is so much bigger, but I'd be lying if I said it doesn't motivate me.""Volkanovski described a ""smirk"" on Makhachev's face when the pair met in Australia while promoting the fight last month.He continued: ""You can just see it, he's just like 'oh this guy', as if it's going to be a walk in the park.""Whether he thinks that or that's just his personality and he always has a smirk on his face, I could be wrong, but I sense that he is looking at this and maybe taking it lightly and if he does, it will not end well for him.""Volkanovski is aiming to follow Conor McGregor, Amanda Nunes, Daniel Cormier and Henry Cejudo in becoming only the fifth simultaneous double champion in UFC history.Since making his UFC debut in 2016, he has embarked on the longest current unbeaten streak in the promotion with 12 wins and has defended the featherweight title four times after becoming champion just over three years ago.Meanwhile, Makhachev is on an 11-fight winning streak himself and is second in the UFC's pound-for-pound rankings following his win over Charles Oliveira for the lightweight title in October.Volkanovski has described the bout with Makhachev as a ""super-fight"".He said: ""The fight itself, no matter where in the world would be massive for me. It's a legacy fight.""Going for champ champ [the double title], fighting Islam and to do it here in Australia is just awesome. ""It's a super-fight, number one versus number two, making history. It's pretty cool and I'm so very happy to be here and to put on a show for everyone.""In defeating long-term rival Max Holloway for a third time in July, Volkanovski opted to move up a division until a new title contender at featherweight established themselves.The co-main event at the RAC Arena features Mexico's Yair Rodriguez facing American Josh Emmett for the interim featherweight belt, with the winner a likely future opponent for Volkanovski.Should he defeat Makhachev, Volkanovski plans to stay active in both divisions.""I want there to be new guys [at featherweight]. I want there to be guys where everyone is screaming 'number one contender' and all that type of stuff,"" said Volkanovski.""I wanted to alternate and I definitely think I can do that. My next fight, whether that's featherweight or lightweight, I want to be very active and fight every three months. ""I'll be keeping both divisions busy. I made that promise and I want to do that.""Volkanovski says he has found the transition to lightweight smooth.""Obviously there was a bit of bulking at the start. With Islam it's a very specific fight, but fights at the lower end of the division you probably don't need to bulk too much,"" he said. ""Now we're bringing my weight down and I'm moving sharp. Now I feel like a featherweight when I'm moving, but I'm as strong as a welterweight. ""I'm looking forward to going out there and showing my stuff at lightweight."""
95,England pick Farrell over Smith at fly-half for Italy,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64598385,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Rugby Unioncomments1438England head coach Steve Borthwick has dropped Marcus Smith and selected Owen Farrell to start at fly-half against Italy in the Six Nations on Sunday.Borthwick has moved his captain from inside centre, where he played in the defeat against Scotland. Ollie Lawrence partners Henry Slade in a new centre partnership, with Joe Marchant not in the 23.Jack Willis replaces Ben Curry in the back row while London Irish wing Henry Arundell is among the replacements.England: Steward; Malins, Slade, Lawrence, Hassell-Collins; Farrell (c), Van Poortvliet; Genge, George, Sinckler; Itoje, Chessum; Ludlam, Willis, DombrandtReplacements: Walker, M Vunipola, Cole, Isiekwe, Earl, Mitchell, M Smith, ArundellThe big decision for Borthwick surrounded who he would choose at fly-half and it is Harlequins' Smith - who has yet to consistently show his club form on the international stage - who has paid the price for last weekend's loss to Scotland.Exeter's Slade returns from a hip injury to partner the in-form Lawrence, while Marchant - a starter in midfield alongside Farrell last week - is not even a replacement.The only other change in the starting XV is Willis being named at openside flanker in place of Curry, who like Marchant is left out of the matchday squad altogether.England are seeking to recover from their opening-round defeat by Scotland and claim the first win of Borthwick's tenure.Speaking at his news conference on Friday, Borthwick focussed on his selection in the centre rather than his choice at fly-half.""It is fantastic to welcome Henry Slade back,"" said England's new head coach.""He is a player that has played very well for his club, has great attributes in the centre and a fantastic left foot.""Ollie Lawrence has played really well all season for his club [Bath] and is on form. We have some exciting players there and that is why we have made the change.""Borthwick emphasised the need for patience as he and his coaching staff try to imprint their ideas on the squad - but believes there are positive signs.The former Leicester coach added: ""Notwithstanding the disappointment of last weekend's Calcutta Cup result, we know that in a very short space of time positive steps have been taken towards the manner and style in which we want to play.""We are at the start of what is a completely new cycle. The implementation of new systems does take time.""I have selected a team that I believe is best placed to meet the specific challenges that Italy will bring. It is a selection of players whose form, individual strengths and combined qualities suit the way we want to play against Italy.""The Azzurri welcome Edoardo Padovani back into the starting line-up for the first time since his try ended their 36-game losing run with a last-gasp win over Wales on the final day of last year's tournament.Saracens prop Marco Riccioni will make his first start since November 2021 while exciting full-back Ange Capuozzo is in line to face England for the first time.Italy: Capuozzo; Padovani, Brex, Morisi, Menoncello; Allan, Varney; Fischetti, Nicotera, Riccioni, N Cannone, Ruzza, Negri, Lamaro, L CannoneReplacements: Bigi, Zani, Ferrari, Iachizzi, Polledri, Zuliani, Fusco, BrunoThese comments are now closed."

101,Arteta criticises officials for 'changing the rules',https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64612850,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section ArsenalArsenal boss Mikel Arteta has accused officials of ""changing the rules"" after claiming Brentford's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Emirates Stadium should have been ruled out for offside.The Gunners had taken the lead in the second half when Leandro Trossard scored his first goal for the club.But Ivan Toney levelled when he nodded in Christian Norgaard's cross from close range.""I just looked back and it is offside, yes,"" said Arteta.Toney's celebrations were delayed for a lengthy check by the video assistant referee (VAR).Norgaard appeared to be offside in the build-up to the 74th-minute goal, while there was a suggestion Ethan Pinnock blocked Gabriel Magalhaes while in an offside position prior to that.However, the decision to award the equaliser stood, leaving Arteta frustrated.""The action when you get blocked when you are offside - you cannot block if you are offside,"" the Arsenal boss added.""You have to apply certain principles in defending and you do that by sticking to the rules. Suddenly you change the rules and then you have to change your principles.""So tell us before, so then you don't hide the line that high, because you're always going to have an advantage if you get blocked.""On the controversial strike, Brentford boss Thomas Frank said: ""I agree that when they kicked the ball, Ethan (Pinnock) is in an offside position.""Then, as far as I know the football laws, the next question is did he influence the cross? They decided it was not enough and I agree.""The point meant Arsenal are now six points clear of Manchester City, who play Aston Villa on Sunday and then visit the Gunners on Wednesday.Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy analysed the Brentford goal on Match of the Day on Saturday and was highly critical of those in charge of the video technology.""Arsenal weren't at their best but I can understand why they are angry at the incompetence of the VAR officials,"" said Murphy. ""It was a horrendous decision. ""The first one is Pinnock blocking Gabriel and he is an offside position. He's stopping Gabriel getting to the ball where Toney is at the back. ""Now if they think that he couldn't have got there and it was just a block and they weren't sure on the offside, maybe you could understand that. But even if he's not blocking him, he is offside. ""They spent three minutes looking at that. The fact they are taking so long on that and panicking a bit, they have then clearly missed the worst offence of all which is the header down, again from Pinnock. Norgaard is obviously in an offside position, but they missed it. ""I am amazed it happened. We have been doing VAR for a long time now. I am also amazed because that should be the first thing they check because it is the last thing that happens directly before the goal.""There was more VAR controversy elsewhere on Saturday when Chelsea were denied a late penalty against West Ham, despite Tomas Soucek appearing to block Conor Gallagher's shot with his arm.The incident was checked but no further action taken.Murphy said on Match of the Day: ""It deprived Chelsea of a win. It was unfathomable. He falls over and saves it with his hands. It is so blatant. It is a lack of understanding of football.""It is getting to a point where it is difficult to comprehend how inefficient VAR is.""Meanwhile, Brighton had a goal incorrectly ruled out for offside because of a human error by the VAR operator in their draw at Crystal Palace.Pervis Estupinan looked to have put the Seagulls in front in the first half.VAR John Brooks intervened and ruled the Ecuador defender to be offside when he received Pascal Gross' pass.However, the offside line was wrongly drawn from James Tomkins rather than his fellow Palace defender Marc Guehi, who was standing just behind him. If the line had been drawn from Guehi, Brighton's left-back would have been onside and the goal would have stood.Former England striker and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: ""The VAR process is seriously flawed. Needs a rethink. Mistakes and ludicrous delays for obvious decisions are sucking the life out of the game.""Ex-England captain Alan Shearer added: ""It has been an awful day for VAR. You couldn't make this up. They put the line in the wrong place.""I don't know what else to say apart from horrendous day for VAR. A terrible, terrible day for the officials and VAR"""

Liverpool then drew 3-3 at Crystal Palace after being 3-0 up, while City won all their remaining games.""Absolutely, they belong to us,"" added Guardiola. ""Regardless of the sentence, they belong to us.""The moment from Sergio Aguero, with (Mario) Balotelli slipping him in. I don't know if we are responsible for Steven Gerrard slipping. In that situation at Anfield I didn't want that, for respect for Steven Gerrard, but is it our fault?""The Premier League will decide but I know what we won, and the way we won it, with the effort we put in.""For something that happened in 2009 or 2010 - I don't know how long ago it was - this is not going to change that one second.""The Premier League has referred City to an independent commission, who can impose punishments ranging from a fine and points deduction to expulsion from the league.The Premier League also accused City of not co-operating since the investigation started in December 2018.City, who were taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008, said they were ""surprised"" by the charges and are supported by a ""body of irrefutable evidence"".On Friday, Guardiola claimed the other 19 top-flight clubs had been the driving force behind the charges implemented by the Premier League.In 2020, nine clubs - Burnley, Wolves, Leicester, Newcastle, Spurs, Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea - wrote to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to request City's two-year European ban for contravening Uefa's Financial Fair Play regulations was not delayed during their appeal process.Their request was dismissed and City won their appeal to Cas.Guardiola said jealousy is ""part of the sport"" and that ""when a team is winning you want to beat them"".He added: ""But what these nine teams have done, I don't forget it. They want the position in the Champions League for the big amount of money to pay for the stadiums they built.""They can be suspicious, that is OK, but (they should) wait.

Hall's four-man crew won three golds and four silvers on the World Cup circuit this season and last week won GB's first four-man bobsleigh medal at the World Championships for 84 years with silver in St Moritz.The two-man season will finish next weekend with a double header in Sigulda.Hall has won four medals on the two-man circuit this season and sits third in the standings.Earlier on Sunday, Britain's Corie Mapp took overall Para-bobsleigh silver after winning the last race of the season in Lillehammer."
104,Five-try England claim first win under Borthwick,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64613621,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Rugby UnionEngland earned a first win of Steve Borthwick's tenure with a pragmatic bonus-point win over Italy in the Six Nations at Twickenham.Jack Willis marked his return to the side with an opening try before Ollie Chessum powered over for the second.Jamie George added a third from close range but Italy hit back after the break through Marco Riccioni.A penalty try sealed the bonus and Henry Arundell scored a fifth, while Alessandro Fusco claimed a consolation.Victory for the hosts - their 30th win in 30 meetings with Italy -  lifts them to third in the table, above defending champions France on points difference, while Italy drop down to fifth.Borthwick's men travel to Cardiff to face Wales in their next game on 25 February, after next weekend's break, as the Azzurri host world number one side Ireland earlier on the same day.After a narrow opening round defeat by Scotland, the task for England was simple: beat perennial Six Nations underperformers Italy and build momentum at the beginning of the Borthwick era.The overriding objective may have been achieved, but for 70 minutes this was far from a vintage England performance.Captain Owen Farrell, moved from inside centre to fly-half, looked for territory but kicked possession away when the hosts had front-foot ball, and Henry Slade had a quiet game on his return to outside centre, but Ollie Lawrence carried and tackled hard in a new-look midfield.Willis was a notable performer, tirelessly hunting anything in a royal blue shirt before being rewarded for his defensive endeavour with the opening try.The Toulouse back row was the beneficiary as England ran a line-out move off the training paddock and mauled their way over the line. Ellis Genge showed deft hands to hand the second to Chessum after inviting contact close to the line and popping off the ball to his former Leicester Tigers team-mate to finish.The line-out ladder has become synonymous with former lock Borthwick and his warm-up contribution with his pack, and the hard work seems to be paying off as George threw in the ball before joining the back of the maul and finishing off the third.A penalty try followed after the interval as Italy were penalised for their ill-discipline at the breakdown but one of the loudest cheers came when the exciting Arundell was introduced from the bench as Twickenham yearned for more free-flowing rugby.The wing had few touches but he was on hand to capitalise as fellow replacement Alex Mitchell spotted a gap in the tiring Azzurri defence late and fed him to dart through and produce an acrobatic finish in the corner.Italy were so close to a huge upset against last year's Grand Slam winners France in their opening game but they ultimately failed to see it through. Facing England at Twickenham has previously been an altogether different tasks. The Azzurri had not beaten England in any of 29 attempts before Sunday but they played with a fluidity that their hosts lacked.They had more possession (52%) and made 286 more metres than England as they looked to keep the ball alive.The visitors did not trouble the scorers in the first 40 minutes, but Riccioni marked his first international start since November 2021 with a powerful surge as many of the spectators inside Twickenham were still to return to their seats at the start of the second half.Ange Capuozzo was a constant threat as he glided across the turf and spun his way out of trouble several times. A second try came through Fusco, who rode the tackle and dived over at full stretch to give the travelling fans a glimmer of hope. Italy's ill-discipline cost them as they conceded two first-half tries while Lorenzo Cannone was in the sin bin, but their attacking intent has to be commended as this young side - with an average age of 26 - continue to employ a fast-paced game. Former England scrum-half Danny Care on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I think Steve Borthwick and the coaches will be happy.  England went back to basics, they kicked well and attacked well, and were clinical when they got chances.""One thing for certain is England are about to play better teams than today. Going to Wales, Wales have not played well at all this tournament and they will pitch up against England.""But away to Ireland and home to France, that is where we will have an indication how good this England team is.""Fair play to Italy they stuck on in there. I think they will beat someone in this tournament if everything comes together.""England: Steward; Malins, Slade, Lawrence, Hassell-Collins; Farrell (c), Van Poortvliet; Genge, George, Sinckler; Itoje, Chessum; Ludlam, Willis, Dombrandt.Replacements: Walker, M Vunipola, Cole, Isiekwe, Earl, Mitchell, M Smith, Arundell.Italy: Capuozzo; Padovani, Brex, Morisi, Menoncello; Allan, Varney; Fischetti, Nicotera, Riccioni, N Cannone, Ruzza, Negri, Lamaro, L CannoneReplacements: Bigi, Zani, Ferrari, Iachizzi, Polledri, Zuliani, Fusco, BrunoReferee: James Doleman (Nzl)Touch judges: Mathieu Raynal (Fra) and Tual Trainini (Fra)TMO: Eric Gauzins (Fra)"
105,Positive England aim to inspire at T20 World Cup,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64593951,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section CricketDespite the stitches in her lip after being hit by the ball during a warm-up match against South Africa, Heather Knight is in good spirits before her side's first outing at the Women's T20 World Cup. Overlooking the vast mountains in the heat of Stellenbosch where the teams are based, England are enjoying some downtime before their campaign begins against West Indies on 11 February.The skipper is calm but positive - which seems to be a buzzword for the brand of cricket she wants her side to play under new coach Jon Lewis.""I'd say it's the best vibe I've felt from a group going into a World Cup before,"" Knight, who is part of a World Cup squad for the 10th time, told BBC Sport. ""We're really clear on how we want to do things, and the warm-ups have been a real success in that regard. ""Now, it's just about taking that mentality under pressure into the big games, and replicate that again to go out and do our thing."" The side have things to put right from the previous T20 World Cup, too. England lost their first group-stage game to South Africa, which cost them down the line when their semi-final against India was washed out. With no reserve days, India automatically went through after topping their group, when England were second. ""I've learned you need to start fast in T20 World Cups,"" said Knight, 32. ""If you slip up early it can cost you, and the games come at you thick and fast. In T20, anyone can beat anyone so you have to start well."" But the mood around the team is positive and relaxed, with England enjoying the benefits of a fresh coach and an injection of youth in the side with the likes of Alice Capsey and Lauren Bell supporting the experience of Knight, Nat and Katherine Sciver-Brunt and Danni Wyatt. ""The women's game is changing all the time and we want to be ahead of the curve with that,"" added Knight. ""Jon has given us real clarity and positivity. He wants us to inspire and to entertain, and we're looking forward to taking teams on more than we have previously."" Despite the attention and magnitude of a World Cup, another cricketing event is lurking - not even in the background, but right in the middle of it. The auction for the Women's Premier League, a women's edition of the world's biggest Twenty20 franchise competition, the Indian Premier League, takes place on Monday, 13 February.It is set to be a game-changing moment for women's cricket, and all England's players have put their names into the draft. As a result, there has been plenty of debate and discussion around who will be picked up, and for how much. ""Talking about it is completely fine, we do talk about it as a group,"" said Knight. ""It's going to be a bit of a distraction, that's a given - it will be for the other teams, too.""But people will deal with it in different ways. It's just about discussing how it might affect you as an individual and working through that whether it's positive or negative, if you get picked up or you don't.""It might put added pressure if someone gets picked up at a high price, for example, so we've just got to keep talking about it and I've got to keep everyone focused on what we are here to do.""Fast bowler Katherine Sciver-Brunt was part of the side that won the inaugural women's T20 World Cup in 2009, the first and last time England won the title. Sciver-Brunt, 37, has faced injury setbacks in the latter stages of her career and discussions around her retirement have lingered each time, but she says Lewis' appointment as head coach and the development of the women's game has sparked more desire to continue. ""If I stop now I'd be happy, but lots of things happen in short spaces of time,"" she said.""Jon Lewis coming in has just reignited some stuff and the environment's amazing.""Sciver-Brunt received one of England's first central contracts in 2014 but since then, the domestic game has developed its professionalism and with the emergence of The Hundred, young players have increased opportunities in the sport. ""I can see the future these girls have got and I'm jealous, I'm not going to lie!"" she said. ""The things that are happening are extremely positive."" And in terms of her future, that positivity and opportunity has presented a bit more of a dilemma.""Where I was clear [about my future] five months ago, I'm now unclear,"" Sciver-Brunt added. ""If we won the World Cup that could be a really good time to stop and five months ago I had promised everyone that's what I would do.""But if we don't win, then the Ashes are two seconds away. I would still be bowling and still be fit. It's not something I can say 'no' to just yet."""

""I was selected in 2013 to ride with El for the first time, and I've only missed once since then which was last year. It'll now be my 10th season of having a European jersey and I'm proud every time I get to do that.""Wales' Barker, who also played a part in the team pursuit win, gave birth to her son in March 2022 and the European Championships marked her first major track competition since returning to the boards.She said: ""After team pursuit Katie said this is the day that we get to do the thing that we're one of the best in the world at. We don't get to do it very often, so let's just go and enjoy it. ""For me it's my first madison for a really long time. I used to do it all the time and maybe forgot quite how special it is, and it's also a privilege to get to ride with somebody like Katie.

I don't think they'll be making the four-hour trip to Llandudno so hopefully I can have a bit of a stress-free week.""It's a change of venue and hopefully a change of luck for me.""Day has never previously been beyond the quarter-finals at the Welsh Open in 17 attempts in the main draw.The 42-year-old world number 18, from Pontycymer near Bridgend, has though already enjoyed a positive season. Day did not make it beyond the last eight of any ranking event last season and failed to qualify for the World Championship for a fourth successive year.But in October he won the British Open, beating Northern Ireland's Mark Allen 10-7 in the final in Milton Keynes. Day's wife Lynsey and daughters Francesca and Lauren were in the arena to see him claim his fourth ranking title and a first prize of ¬£100,000.""It was great because a lot of close family and friends were there. It was an extra-special moment,"" said Day, who puts a new positive mindset down to working with Chris Henry.Day rang the renowned coach after a painful defeat in the 2021 German Masters:""I played Barry Hawkins. I was 4-0 up, it was the first to five and I couldn't see myself winning. It was where I was mentally at the time and I knew I needed a fresh outlook,"" he explained. ""When I played Mark Allen in the British Open final I got to 9-7 up and I didn't have any doubt in my mind that I was going to cross the line. ""That's just one of the aspects we've worked on and it's paid dividends.""The British Open win lifted Day back into the world's top 16, which meant he played at the Masters last month for the first time since 2019. He came close to beating eventual champion Judd Trump in the first round but lost 6-5 after leading 5-3. Despite that disappointment Day, who will be 43 next month, feels he can continue to compete at the top level for some time yet:""I ran Judd close,"" he said.  ""It's the worst I've felt for quite some time after losing, but Mark Williams, John Higgins and Ronnie O'Sullivan are all 47. ""Maybe there's life in the old dog yet.""Day is one of six Welsh players whose Welsh Open qualifying round matches have been held over to Llandudno for the first day of the tournament. He will play against Stuart Carrington. Three-time world champion Mark Williams will face fellow Welshman Michael White.Jackson Page will take on 2015 world champion Stuart Bingham and two amateur teenage players have been given wildcards, with 16-year-old Liam Davies from Tredegar facing Noppon Saengkham and 17-year-old Oliver Briffett-Payne from Risca taking on Robbie Williams.

111,Saffrons rally comes too late as Dublin hold on,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gaelic-games/64616671,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Gaelic GamesAntrim's rally came too late as they suffered another Division One defeat in the Allianz Hurling League as Dublin held on for a 0-28 to 2-19 win.Dublin led 0-21 to 0-11 after 46 minutes at Parnell Park and despite a Keelan Molloy goal, they were still 0-28 to 1-15 ahead after 65 minutes. But Molloy's second goal started a late unanswered run of 1-4 which could have been even better for the Saffrons.Dublin were seriously rattled late on but held on for a three-point win.With Neil McManus having gone close to hitting two Antrim goals earlier in the second half, the Saffrons were left with a sense of what might have been even though they had looked decidedly second best for most of the contest.Donal Burke's 10 points - including five from play - had helped the Dubs appear in total control before the energy seemed to drain from them in the closing minutes as Antrim suddenly started winning all the possession.But while Antrim hit the closing five scores, they missed a number of other chances to further reduce Dublin's lead and the home side were mightily relieved when Cork referee Colm Lyons blew the final whistle in the fourth minute of added time.Not for the first time, Antrim made a slow and sloppy start as poor handling and bad passing helped the Dubs strike the opening five points in the first nine minutes.A couple of early missed frees by Conal Cunning didn't steady Saffrons nerves although he did open Antrim's account in the 10th minute with a fine effort from play from a tight angle.The score started a more profitable period of action for Antrim as they cut Dublin's lead to 0-6 to 0-5 by the 20th minute.However, Burke's second point got Dublin going again as they fired six out of the next seven scores to move 0-12 to 0-6 up by the 31st minute. Antrim felt they might have been denied a penalty when 0-10 to 0-6 down as Seann Elliott burst through the Dublin defence, with Lyons judging that he had lost his footing rather than being fouled.The margin was increased to seven by half-time as the home side responded to Paddy Burke and Cunning scores with further points from the Burkes, Conor and Donal (two).While Cunning notched the first score after the resumption, the game did appear over as two more Donal Burke points in a run of four helped Dublin 0-19 to 0-9 after 43 minutes.The margin was still 10 after 46 minutes and the conviction that the game was going to peter out into nothingness was only increased as Dublin keeper Eddie Gibbons denied a McManus goal effort before the Cushendall star saw another fierce goalbound effort come back off the crossbar.And while Molloy did rattle the Dublin net in the 51st minute, the Dubs responded with three unanswered points in 90 seconds to still lead 0-24 to 1-12 after 53 minutes.The home side's lead was once again 10 five minutes before the end of normal time after another sensational Burke point was followed by a free which brought up his tally to 0-10.But neither Burke nor Dublin managed another score in the remaining nine minutes of action as the roof nearly fell in on them following Molloy's second goal. Four further Antrim scores followed as Dublin simply couldn't get their hands on the ball but amid the frantic finish, the Saffrons lacked the necessary composure which could possibly have seen them snatch the most improbable of victories.After losing their opener at home to Kilkenny, the Saffrons share bottom spot with Laois in Division One B with Dublin moving to three points alongside Waterford - one behind leaders Tipperary who beat Kilkenny 2-24 to 1-21 at Nowlan Park.In Division Two, Down suffered a second successive defeat as they were edged out 1-17 to 0-9 in Kildare.Ronan Sheehan's Mourne side led 0-11 to 0-7 after 29 minutes and despite Cathal McCabe's Kildare goal, the visitors still had a 0-14 to 1-9 advantage at half-time.While the scored began to dry up in the second half, Down were 0-17 to 1-12 up up after 64 minutes but four unanswered points saw Kildare lead by two as the match entered injury-time and McCabe's point proved the winner despite Pearse Og McCrickard hitting the final score of the match.It was a very different story at Tullamore as Offaly substitute Eoghan Cahill hit 0-12 after being introduced in the first half as the home side eased to a 0-33 to 1-15 win over Derry.The Oak Leafers led 0-8 to 0-7 after 30 minutes and while Offaly then hit six unanswered points, a Reece McSorley goal left only two between the teams at half-time.However, the second half was a procession of Offaly scores as they struck 20 points to pull away from the northerners."
112,'Man Utd are developing that winning mentality',https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64617293,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Women's FootballIf Manchester United are to win their first Women's Super League title, they are likely to endure more weeks like the one they have just had.Marc Skinner's side bounced back from a disappointing 0-0 draw with Everton seven days ago with a gritty, dramatic and frantic victory over Tottenham on Sunday. The 2-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium took United back to the top of the WSL table - one point above defending champions Chelsea. But they were made to work for it.United had to score twice in the second half - either side of Bethany England's superb equaliser - and saw out a nervy affair with 10 players after key midfielder Ella Toone was sent off. And, on a weekend when Arsenal dropped out of the top three with defeat to Manchester City - now only three points behind rivals United - Skinner's team did what was needed: win at all costs.""We still have so much growth to come. The reality is we had to win but we don't [assume] we'll get anything; we have to earn it,"" said Skinner. ""It's good to be top of the table but look how good teams are in this country. I love it. There's so many more twists to happen yet. We can just keep trying to win games of football.""Last week, Skinner said he did not believe his side were feeling the pressure of being a team chased in the WSL this season.Goalscorer Leah Galton confirmed that on Sunday, saying: ""I've been in other teams in this position and it's a very stressful environment because you have to win. Right now I feel everyone's pretty relaxed.""But United were playing within themselves in the first half at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and despite controlling possession, took 67 minutes to get the breakthrough.Celebrations at full-time showed their desperation to cling on after tensions had clearly ran high when Toone reacted in a tangle with Eveliina Summanen.The victory was not pretty but it showed in abundance United's desire to win. Skinner told Sky Sports afterwards that ""winners aren't created overnight"" but this was further progression.""I'm not surprised by the ambitions of the club, but we're trying to do something which is very difficult to do - win when we haven't got that in our history yet,"" said Skinner.Former England striker Kelly Smith said United had ""made a statement"", while ex-England international Fern Whelan said: ""United are developing that winning mentality over the course of the season. ""We saw them beat Arsenal at the Emirates, coming from behind. They might not have the experience of winning yet, but that's what they're aiming to do.""This result points to a stark contrast in trajectories at United and Tottenham.Last season, Spurs demonstrated a desire to close the gap on the WSL's top four and had ambitions in the summer to shorten it further. They showed that in an 8-0 win over Brighton in October.But since then, their direction has only been downwards, as defeat by United was their seventh successive loss in the WSL.They have been dragged into a relegation battle after Leicester's crucial 1-0 win over Liverpool meant the gap between the bottom side and Tottenham is now just three points. However, Spurs manager Rehanne Skinner remains optimistic on her side's future and there were signs against United that suggest she has reason to be. They showed an immediate response to conceding in the second half when England equalised and tested United's defence on several occasions on the counter-attack. Spurs also frustrated United's star-studded forward line in the first half, showing a growth in performances from their dismal displays at the end of 2022.""We didn't deserve to win games [before Christmas]. That was the situation we were in,"" said Rehanne Skinner. ""But there's a lot of positives to be taken out of [Sunday's defeat]. We've got belief that we're going to get results and it's just a matter of time. We showed confidence from the first whistle. We kept battling.""Those characteristics, when you stick together, will help you get results. We're absolutely confident those results are coming.""Skinner also pointed to their recruitment in January which has already proved successful as England, who joined from Chelsea for a British record fee, has scored in three successive matches.Mana Iwabuchi, signed on loan from Arsenal for the remainder of the season, was also a shrewd addition who showed quality at times against United."
113,Who deserves half his team's bonus money? Garth Crooks' Team of the Week,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64619991,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Premier LeagueAt the end of every Premier League round of fixtures, BBC football pundit Garth Crooks is on hand to give you his Team of the Week.But who has he picked this time? Take a look and then pick your own team below. As ever, Garth also has his say on the game's big talking points in the Crooks of the Matter. Crystal Palace players need to give Guaita half of their bonus money at the end of this month after their goalkeeper's performance against Brighton. Palace were poor and it still took a wonder goal by Solly March to finally beat him. Two saves from Alexis Mac Allister were fairly routine for a keeper of Guaita's class but the one-handed save from Kaoru Mitoma, pushing the ball wide of the post, was straight out of the top drawer. Brighton would and should have won this game had it not been for an error by Robert Sanchez in their goal. I keep saying it - goalkeepers who win you points are worth their weight in gold.   I'm beginning to think Shaw looks more comfortable in central defence than he does at full-back. The England left-back deputised at centre-back for Lisandro Martinez when he was recovering from his World Cup exploits and made my team of the week on a couple of occasions to prove the point. He then got a roasting by Bukayo Saka at Arsenal but has since recovered. He played for an unblemished 60 minutes in the middle against Leeds at Elland Road before returning to his more familiar full-back position for the final 30 minutes and provided the assist for Marcus Rashford to score. Shaw has become a valued member of Erik ten Hag's team in a way he wasn't under Jose Mourinho. I wonder what Mourinho makes of Luke Shaw and United now.   The tackle by Faes on Harry Kane during Leicester's win over Tottenham was as emphatic as it was brilliant. Kane knew that if he had attempted to try to win the ball, he would have been nursing a sore ankle for some time.  In the days of yesteryear, strikers such as Chelsea's Ian Hutchinson or the great Peter Osgood, and a good many others, sacrificed themselves on the altar of hubris, vendettas and chasing lost causes. They have been replaced by those who work by the motto: Pick your battles - you'll play longer. This was a tackle of such precision by and magnitude by Faes that it not only won Leicester the ball but created a goal out of nothing. Best tackle I've seen in years.     For the second consecutive week, I find myself singing the praises of Dawson and selecting him in my team. The former West Ham defender seems to have taken total responsibility for Wolverhampton Wanderers' defending. Why Julen Lopetegui, the former Spain manager now in charge at Wolves, would go for such a typical no nonsense English defender like Dawson is of real interest. Meanwhile, Southampton sacked Nathan Jones immediately after the defeat against Wolves after just three months in charge. I've no doubt the defeat against Brentford, where he openly criticised his players in his post-match interview, was ill advised. When a team loses four of their first five matches, it can't just be the players at fault.    After such an impressive result against Manchester City last week, Tottenham lost comprehensively to a Leicester side who up until recently were struggling to find some form themselves. That result is the biggest indication that Antonio Conte does not have a proper grip of this Spurs team. Conte's side fell apart in a matter of minutes. The architect of Leicester's superb attacking performance was James Maddison. If he wasn't supplying wonderful opportunities for Kelechi Iheanacho to score, he was laying on chances for Harvey Barnes - and if all else failed, he would just score himself.  A devastating display by Maddison. His manager had the audacity to leave De Bruyne out against Spurs and paid the price. The service to Erling Haaland, the best goalscorer in the league, from the best provider in the league was suddenly non-existent. De Bruyne's return against Aston Villa was an absolute must particularly amid one of the most turbulent weeks in Manchester City's history. The victory over Villa moves them back into second place with a trip to Arsenal on Wednesday that could, should they win, take them top of the table. If City need a tonic to lift them from the weight of the accusations surrounding the club, then a win next Wednesday will be it. Read more about Manchester City's greatest challenge in the Crooks of the Matter below.     If a club spends ¬£600m on 17 players, then I expect that team to look a bit special. I would also expect that team to have some of the best players in the world with a manager of similar status. Currently Chelsea possess neither. In fact the Blues looked ordinary against West Ham. I will concede, particularly on this performance, Enzo Fernandez looks like a player that might really shine in the Premier League. However, I would like to ask Todd Boehly how could he spend all that money and not buy one genuine world-class striker? I assume the Chelsea owner knows what he's doing. If not, he should get a very good technical director that does - and quickly. Brighton, Fulham and Brentford currently sit above them with a fraction of the money Chelsea have spent. This player was always capable of scoring a goal of immense quality because he is a player of immense quality. His spells at Arsenal and Corinthians are best forgotten - but since he arrived at Fulham, the Brazilian has looked like the player he was at Chelsea during their glory days. Marco Silva has got Craven Cottage buzzing again; this latest win halted Nottingham Forest's unbeaten run. It was only a matter of time before it came to an end - however, Steve Cooper's side have done extremely well. Three months ago, I gave them no chance of surviving in the Premier League - now they have a chance.    Rashford always looked menacing against Leeds - and got his reward when he latched on to the most exquisite cross from Shaw to dispatch a bullet header past a stranded Illan Meslier.I think it is very telling that United's results have continually improved since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and so has Rashford's presence in the team. The England striker no longer has to play second fiddle to a player desperate to hang on to former glories who has far more interest in himself than the team. The problem has been removed and United look like a proper football team again.  He should have had a hat-trick but the performance in itself was good enough to make my selection. Ivan Toney is looking like the player who won an England call-up prior to the World Cup. Arsenal might have won this fixture had the official running VAR not fallen asleep. I find it particularly interesting that Mikel Arteta has only made 14 changes to his league leaders this season and kept an unchanged side for his sixth consecutive match against Brentford. Perhaps the emphasis on rotation by the sports scientists might have been overplayed in some quarters.  A few weeks ago, Leicester were struggling but they weren't panicking. I was particularly struck by the relaxed nature of manager Brendan Rodgers in his post-match interviews, which is always a good sign that managers are in control of the situation. Rodgers is a good coach and there is no doubt he seems to have got Iheanacho back to his best again. We know the Nigeria international can score goals but he is at his best when his touch is good, he sees the pass and is generally wreaking havoc in opposition defences. And that is precisely what he did against Tottenham. If Conte were to leave Spurs at the end of the season, they could do much worse than installing Rodgers at the helm in his place.     When the news broke that Manchester City had been charged with more than 100 breaches of Premier League financial rules, it was clear there would be repercussions. When it became apparent that these alleged contraventions were between 2009 and 2018, fans around the country were outraged.City's accusers have alleged systematic wrongdoing over a long period of time. Should City lose this case, the punishment must be severe. In a recent press conference, manager Pep Guardiola struggled to contain his contempt for the decision by the Premier League to charge his club - stating, indignantly, that they had already been sentenced. The quality of football produced by City under the guidance of Guardiola has been breathtaking at times - but this is not about football. It is about the way the game is governed. City cannot afford to lose this battle because everything they have is riding on this fixture. Pick your XI from our list and share with your friends."

""Would I be disappointed? Of course, because part of my belief in what this club is currently doing will have been broken. ""The day before the verdict and the day after the verdict, I'll still be a City fan and support them.""The Premier League said on Monday that City breached rules requiring them to provide ""accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club's financial position"".It also accused City of not co-operating since the investigation started in December 2018.The commission can impose punishments ranging from a fine and points deduction to expulsion from the Premier League.""[The achievements] will be tainted if the club are found guilty,"" added Parker.""If anything I'm hoping as a City fan it has this mentality to bring everyone together.""No matter what might happen in the future, nobody can take away some of the special moments we've had.""No matter what happens off the field, nobody can take those fantastic moments away from us.""City said in a statement: ""The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position.""As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all."""

All three have now been traded, with Harden leaving for the Philadelphia 76ers last year and Irving joining the Dallas Mavericks this week.Durant previously won back-to-back championships with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018, and was named as the Finals MVP on both occasions.The Suns, who were beaten by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2021 NBA Finals, will now be seen as strong contenders for the title. They are currently sixth in the Western Conference.The Nets are fifth in the Eastern Conference and still in play-off contention. They also acquired Jae Crowder in the trade with the Suns but subsequently dealt him to the Bucks.The Lakers, who missed last year's play-offs, are attempting to salvage their season as they currently lie 13th in the Western Conference.In the Westbrook deal they acquired point guard D'Angelo Russell, who started his career with the Lakers, from the Minnesota Timberwolves as well as guard Malik Beasly and power forward Jarred Vanderbilt from the Jazz.The Timberwolves acquired point guard Mike Conley and shooting guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker from the Jazz.The Lakers then continued their mid-season makeover by trading Patrick Beverly to the Orlando Magic in exchange for centre Mo Bamba in a deal that also involved the Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets.The Lakers' need for extensive changes was evident on Thursday night as they fell to a 115-106 defeat by the Bucks, albeit in the absence of LeBron James, who sat out with an ankle injury.Elsewhere on a busy day of deals before Thursday's trade deadline, the defending champion Warriors brought back point guard Gary Payton II, who won last year's title with them, in a deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.The Trail Blazers acquired forward Kevin Knox from the Detroit Pistons, who received James Wiseman from the Warriors. The Atlanta Hawks acquired Saddiq Bey from the Pistons as part of the deal."

""There were teams last year that pushed us but we knew we could take the wins. This year is more of an unknown. ""The competitiveness hopefully will improve - we want our league to be professional and to do that we have to have a product that shows it's competitive,"" added Greig.With the spread of talent more evenly distributed throughout the league this season and new coaches implementing new philosophies, could a team traditionally outside the top four spring a surprise?Mavericks head coach Buchanan said this year is more about ""building"" for her side, who have finished just outside the top four for the past four seasons, while Stars' Trip is eying a couple of upsets.""We are determined to win 50% of the games. We are a team that could knock off some of the top teams and be highly competitive in each match,"" she said.""We will bite at your ankles all game.""Storm, having signed two England Roses, look a dangerous outfit having also retained last season's top scorer Proscovia Peace.""We want to be in the top four,"" said Peace. ""You can't do that if you don't nail the basics. We are going to embrace it and enjoy it.""While focus is now on the domestic season, players will be using this period as their last chance to impress and book a coveted seat on the plane to July's World Cup in South Africa.""There's a definite buzz - it's a big netball year,"" said Stars' Trip.England head coach Jess Thirlby will be in attendance at matches up and down the country through the season as selection for her side looms.Thunder's South Africa defender Shadine van der Merwe said she will use the season to gather information on her international opponents which she can take back to her team.""Norma Plummer [South Africa head coach] wants us to play abroad to gain that experience in the league. It helps a lot,"" she said.""But it is important to remember what you're here for - being the best for your franchise.""Thunder's Greig agreed, adding: ""I've got a duty to help the players as much as I can to get them in the best possible position to be challenging for selection. But first and foremost is to get the season done."""

But I am not sure if me going round clapping would have shown respect.""Southampton supporters had chanted ""you're getting sacked in the morning"" and ""Nathan Jones, get out of our club"" after their previous league defeat at Brentford.Jones gave an emotional response to that 3-0 loss, saying he had ""let the players down"".""I haven't really put my own stamp on it and I should have by now,"" Jones told the BBC's Match of the Day programme.""I want to be brutally honest with this - I have let the players down.""Jones succeeded Ralph Hasenhuttl in November on a three-and-a-half-year contract after leaving Championship side Luton.He lost four of his first five matches in charge, with the only victory in that run a 2-1 EFL Cup win over League One Lincoln.But three wins in the space of a week over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup, Manchester City in the EFL Cup and Everton in the Premier League, then suggested Jones might have turned their fortunes around, only for back to back league defeats to end his reign.Jones made his name during two successful spells with Luton, either side of an ill-fated 38 matches in charge of Stoke City.He initially took over at Kenilworth Road in 2016 with the Hatters struggling in League Two, guiding them to second in League One, before being tempted to make the step up to the Championship with Stoke in 2019. After winning just six of those 38 matches, Jones returned to a Luton side 23rd in the Championship, helping them stay up on the final day of the 2019-20 season.He then led them to last season's Championship play-offs, where they were beaten by Huddersfield Town in the semi-finals, and signed a new five-year deal with the Hatters last January.These comments are now closed."

Referee Declan Hassan adjudged that Dean Curry handled the ball inside the area, with Forsythe stepping up and sending Dungannon goalkeeper Declan Dunne the wrong way.The Crues made sure of the three points shortly after the break as Heatley showed some neat footwork before passing the ball past a helpless Dunne in the Swifts goal.Just moments later the hosts had their third as Lecky controlled beautifully inside the penalty area before finding the back of the net through the legs of the Swifts 'keeper.Ethan McGee was sent for an early shower on 78 minutes for a second yellow card to make Dungannon's afternoon even worse. In a quiet opening half at Warden Street, Ballymena had appeals for a penalty turned away after Ryan Waide tumbled over the outstretched leg of Barney McKeown.Ballymena skipper Josh Kelly side-footed an effort over after a David McDaid cut-back.Portadown came close to opening the scoring on 58 minutes when Luke Wilson's header from a Reece Jordan corner was headed off the line by Mikey Place.The visitors had another opening when Alberto Balde collected a Mark Russell cross and cut inside but then blazed his shot wastefully over.Ballymena stay in seventh position while Portadown remain rooted firmly at the foot of the table."

It has opened up now. We can face the best, we showed that, it's about being consistent.""Arsenal had kept 16 clean sheets in their previous 21 away WSL matches but struggled to cope with Hemp on the left wing, Kelly on the right flank and Khadija Shaw, the league's top scorer, through the middle.Zinsberger made a couple of saves to deny Shaw as well as Filippa Angeldahl and Kelly, with Yui Hasegawa also hitting the crossbar.""We know we're creating a lot of chances and we're not stupid, we need to score more goals - it needs to improve,"" added Hemp.City have not lost at home in the WSL in 14 games, a run stretching back to November 2021, and were cheered on by a crowd of 4,542 at Academy Stadium.""It was a brilliant day and we knew when we play at home that nobody can play against us,"" said Kelly, named player of the match after a goal and an assist.""Gaz [Taylor] just gives me confidence at the moment, he's letting me play free and I'm enjoying myself on the pitch.""When I'm enjoying myself, that's when I'm at my best and just having fun really.""It's like I'm a little girl just playing football and I'm having fun.

""The whole team were an inspiration back home,"" said Pandey, before India's opening game against Pakistan.""We all said that if they have done it, we need to do it for the country as well.""Pandey, 33, who has only recently returned to the India team, added: ""After the 2017 Women's World Cup where we lost to England in the final, a lot of people said that was the watershed moment.""But I think the World Cup coming to India is. For a young kid too see that it motivates them.""It is just the beginning of something really spectacular for cricket in India, having women who are 15-years-old on a winning World Cup side shows where the sport is going.""Pandey, has high hopes for India going into the senior team's own World Cup, which is being hosted by South Africa.""I think we are good contenders,"" she said. ""I'm really excited to play alongside top international cricketers around the world and learning how they prepare. ""I think we have a really good chance of winning the World Cup.""Captaining the winning side was 19-year-old all-rounder Shafali Verma, India's youngest ever Twenty20 international player.Verma has also been named in the squad for the World Cup alongside U19 team-mate Richa Ghosh. ""I wish I was like Shafali Verma sometimes because she doesn't carry any baggage with her and she is someone who is really confident about her abilities,"" said Pandey.""She is a very jolly character and is all about enjoying the moment. Characters like Shafali can only help the game grow back home.""Pandey made her T20 international debut in 2014 against Bangladesh and in August of the same year, she made her one-day international and Test cricket debuts, both against England.She is now set to make a comeback after 15 months out and is ready for redemption after being left out of India's World Cup squad last year.""At any level you play cricket your ultimate goal is to play for your country and to win the World Cup so I'm hoping we go one step further this time and win it,"" she said.""It feels really good to be back in the side, I've worked really hard for the past year and I've had to do the hard work to reach where I have.""I was heartbroken very honestly, I am human at the end of the day. I've always been taught as a kid that dreams don't turn to dust and hard work never goes to waste so I just kept working hard and I knew that I had a lot of cricket left in me.""During India's tour of Australia in 2021, seamer Pandey dismissed Alyssa Healy with what some commentators dubbed ""he ball of the century"", after it seamed back in sharply to bowl the Australia batter after pitching outside off stump.Reminiscing about the wicket, Pandey described it as an ""inswinger's dream delivery"".""It was special to get her out because Healy is the kind of player that can take the game away from you in a span of four or five overs,"" recalled Pandey.""I'm really happy that the ball came through and when I'm no longer playing cricket, it'll be remembered.""

146,Rodrigues leads India to tense win over Pakistan,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64617535,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section CricketJemimah Rodrigues' unbeaten 53 from 38 balls led India to a seven-wicket win over rivals Pakistan in their opening Women's T20 World Cup fixture. Chasing 150, Rodrigues and Richa Ghosh added 58 for the fourth wicket to steer India to victory. Pakistan were eyeing a shock victory, with India needing 28 from the final three overs.But their bowlers struggled for control at the death as India reached their target with an over to spare.Pakistan's impressive total of 149-4 was set up by an entertaining partnership of 81 from 47 balls between captain Bismah Maroof, who hit an unbeaten 68, and 18-year-old Ayesha Naseem's unbeaten 43 from 25 balls. Favourites India were ragged in the field, particularly when put under pressure by the dynamic Naseem, who was dropped twice on 35 and 36. Despite a poor finish in the field, India started their chase brightly with Under-19 World Cup-winning captain Shafali Verma striking 33 from 25 balls before she was brilliantly caught on the long-off boundary by Sidra Ameen. Momentum shifted towards a shock Pakistan victory when captain Harmanpreet Kaur fell for 16 with India 93-3. But 19-year-old Ghosh smashed three fours from the 18th over, followed by three more from Rodrigues in the penultimate over to secure an eventually comfortable win.Chasing down a total with an over and seven wickets to spare suggests a smooth victory for India, but they were constantly pushed by their rivals throughout - and Pakistan will rue the loose bowling that cost them under pressure in the final two overs.India were taken by surprise by Pakistan's aggressive approach with the bat, evident in their body language in the closing stages of the first innings - 33 runs were plundered from the last three overs and India's fielders stood in disbelief with hands on hips.While Bismah anchored the innings, it was Naseem's fearlessness that had the crowd roaring as she smashed the only two sixes of the day into the stands. Young talent also shone in India's innings, as they were missing star opener Smriti Mandhana with a finger injury, and Harmanpreet made just 16. Shafali, 19, ensured India started quickly while Rodrigues, 22, and teenager Ghosh paced their innings' beautifully to steer their side to victory. However, controversy was thankfully avoided after umpire Jackie Williams' miscalculation meant that seven balls were bowled in the seventh over - with the extra ball going for four - and had the game gone to the final ball, things could have been significantly more dramatic.Player of the Match Jemimah Rodrigues: ""This innings means a lot as I haven't had a score for a long time. My parents are here today and I want to dedicate this to them as they have always been behind me.""We just had over-by-over targets rather than looking at the big picture. We knew if we were there at the end we could do it. There will always be a loose ball and we had to punish it.""Pakistan captain Bismah Maroof: ""We were in the game all the time but they finished really well. We made mistakes in the bowling unit. There are a lot of learnings we can take into the next game.""India captain Harmanpreet Kaur: ""Every match is important but obviously Pakistan is always special. It was a good game and the crowd was fantastic.""Pakistan batted really well but we wanted to win this game. Jemimah and Richa played really well, sensible batting from both of them."""

151,'Russell reminds us why we fell in love with rugby',https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64613800,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Scottish RugbyWith the touch of a magician, Finn Russell made all of rugby's problems disappear on Saturday evening, if only for a little while. All the concerns about tackle height and brain injury, all the controversies of governance and finance and myriad issues about where on earth this troubled sport is heading vanished for 40 breathless minutes as the one-time stonemason built an insurmountable lead for a record-busting Scotland.If you weren't Welsh you could luxuriate in the excellence of what he did out there. The subtlety of his hands, the accuracy of his cross-kicks, the authority, the vision, the class. The daring. The ability to make everything look so simple and such fun. Wales didn't know what to do with Russell in that second half. The try that turned a sticky game into the beginnings of a rout was Kyle Steyn's first one in the right-hand corner when Russell took out three Welsh defenders before offloading out the side door, like Sonny Bill Williams on his best day. He did it at such pace and with such clarity that you could never tire of watching it. Russell gave the final pass or the final kick for three of Scotland's five tries. He's given the assist on 10 tries in his last nine Test matches since the beginning of last year, a number no other top tier player has matched in that same period. In full flight, Russell reminds us of why we fell in love with rugby. Not for the collisions or the hard cases - for sure, they have for their place - but for the artists. Defence coaches are lauded now. The game is packed with experts with laptops spewing out video and data to aid game plans on how to neutralise people like Russell, but blessed are the days when attack triumphs over defence. And this was one of them.When Scotland started to play with urgency the visitors must have felt like they were playing a game of Whack A Mole. No matter how many Scottish attackers they put down, another would pop up. Duhan van der Merwe didn't score, but he ran for 150m (almost 50m more than his Twickenham tour-de-force). Only Ireland's Hugo Keenan topped him with a frankly absurd 205m against France in Dublin. Huw Jones and Sione Tuipulotu didn't score and assist as they did a week ago, but they presented a constant threat. It wasn't always what they did with the ball that distracted Wales, it was the fear of what they might do. Their reputations went before them. The least heralded member of that Scottish backline is probably Steyn and he scored twice. Blair Kinghorn came on early after Stuart Hogg failed an HIA and ran with such power and purpose from full-back that we can now announce the official death of the Blair Switch Project. Kinghorn was, is and always will be most effective at 15 and was such a presence in his 67 minutes on the pitch that it made you wonder if Gregor Townsend might contemplate pressing the nuclear button by playing him from the start in Paris instead of Hogg.The head coach's selectorial tombola is not what it was. In the interests of consistency and cohesion he's likely to keep things as they are, given the chance. Kinghorn off the bench has become a hell of a weapon, though. Positionally, he's had a nomadic few months for club and country. Moving between 10, wing and full-back might have damaged his confidence, but his impact has been terrific. Despite being jettisoned at fly-half when the prodigal returned in the autumn, Kinghorn is playing some of the best stuff of his life in his new-old role.The sophistication of Scotland's attack in their opening two games of the championship has been something to see. Nine tries scored. All different types, all different skills involved, some startling solo runs, some epic team scores, some from grunt, others from grace. Trying to pick a favourite among them is like trying to choose your favourite child. Scotland have had a razor sharp attack before, of course. They've also had, in 2020 and 2021, a mean defence. What they haven't had nearly often enough is attack and defence functioning consistently at the same time in victory. They're getting there now.Even if they were all available, Rory Sutherland, Stuart McInally, Scott Cummings, Sam Skinner, Hamish Watson and Rory Darge would struggle to make it into this 23 not to mind the starting XV. They may need injuries to others to make it. As sure as night follows day, those injuries will come.Squad depth is king. You can achieve nothing without it. And Townsend has it. With two bonus point wins in the bag along with an amount of momentum, Scotland are in the kind of place they could scarcely have dreamed about just over a week ago. This is when it gets really tough, though. Brutally so. In a fortnight they go to Paris and a fortnight after that they have Ireland in Edinburgh. That's the world number two and the world number one who just went toe-to-toe in one of rugby's greatest games.Townsend has rarely looked more assured - or happier - in his role than he does now. He said that Scotland went from a seven out of 10 against England to an eight out of 10 against Wales, but feels that a nine out of 10 will be required to beat France. He's right.He didn't say what might be needed to beat Ireland, but given that Andy Farrell's team have now defeated France, South Africa, New Zealand (twice), Wales (twice), Scotland, Australia and England in the last year despite injuries to key men along the way, let's call it a 10. Or an 11.France are Scotland's focus for now. They've had one scratchy win against Italy and one defeat against Ireland, which will have angered them greatly. Losing to Scotland, with their home World Cup so close, would spark uproar with the big show not far down the road. To head it off at the pass, a ferocious French response is coming Scotland's way. There's no greater certainty.France will come for Russell and you get the feeling that Russell wouldn't have it any other way. He returns to Paris now and will most likely be playing for Racing against Brive next Saturday. Brive are one place off the bottom, desperate for points and unlikely to take prisoners.  It'll be a game to watch in the company of a stiff drink and a fervent hope that The Man gets through it unscathed.  With him on board at the Stade a week later, Scotland will be entitled to feel that anything is possible."

The prize increase is designed to compete with the winnings on offer in the LIV Golf series which offers $25m per tournament.Scheffler started the final round with a two-stroke lead but saw that halved immediately as both Taylor and Rahm birdied the first.He hit back with birdies on the second and third holes, while Rahm's challenge faded with a bogey at eight.With six holes remaining, Taylor and Scheffler were tied for the lead before the American drained an eagle putt on the 13th to take outright control.Scheffler then holed a 15-foot clutch putt on the par-three 16th to preserve his advantage before a comfortable par on the last sealed his fifth title on the PGA Tour, and his first since his win at Augusta in April.He is the third player to successfully defend a PGA Tour title this season after McIlroy at the CJ Cup and Max Homa at the Fortinet Championship."

We all want to create 'scoring' defences. This is a big part of their game and the personnel that they have to do that suits them.""Ireland, ranked world number one, are bidding for a record 13th consecutive home win, having started their campaign with a convincing 34-10 away win against Wales last weekend.France are on a record run of 14 consecutive victories under Fabien Galthie and are the last side to have beaten Ireland at the Aviva Stadium, in the 2021 Six Nations.They are also the sole top-tier side Farrell is yet to get the better of since he took over after the 2019 Rugby World Cup.Farrell is impressed with the job Galthie has done - although France were made to battle for a 29-24 weekend win over Italy on the opening weekend.""They are a fantastic team. I was speaking to Fabien Galthie at the Six Nations launch and congratulated him,"" said Farrell.""They could not have done any better. The way they have played speaks volumes where they are at this time.""The backroom staff and players have really got something going, indeed French rugby generally is buzzing at the moment.""Farrell confirmed his squad had ""addressed wholeheartedly"" the issue of conceding so many penalties against Wales and were ready to match the physicality of their opponents.""You win collisions by running into space. You have to be balanced enough mentally and physically to make good decisions. Physicality isn't just about size, it's about being smart too and I feel we have a group of smart players,"" argued Farrell.He emphasised the part Ireland's supporters could play in Saturday's contest.""It's a package. It's everyone who comes to the game buying into it - and we're part of that package. ""Obviously everyone wants to start well and it's something we've done pretty well but things aren't all going to go according to plan when two good teams are going at it. ""It isn't just getting behind us and getting excited through the good times. ""It's also making sure the fans feel where we're at in the game as well and try to drag us through because it's certainly what our players felt last year in France.""Three Ireland forwards - lock James Ryan and props Andrew Porter and Dave Kilcoyne - are set to reach 50 caps this weekend.""I remember James' first cap and that was special. I remember him going out against a big French pack and taking the game to them. ""Since then, the stature which he's grown within the group has been phenomenal.""They all look up to him, whether he knows that or not. They do look up to him. It says a lot about his character. ""His game is developing all the time, his attacking game is developing and his decision-making is developing but he's never lost those point of differences and that's his work ethic and fight. ""He's got real inner strength to show his will to win so hopefully all that comes out on Saturday.""Ryan and Porter made their debuts against the United States in June 2017, while replacement prop Kilcoyne first pulled on the green jersey back in November 2012.""It's special to be so consistent to get to 50 caps. It says a lot about how much the game means to them and how much it means to play for Ireland,"" said Farrell. ""Fifty caps isn't celebrated as it should be - we as a squad have started to celebrate it, I brought that in.""I think it's a phenomenal achievement - Dave Kilcoyne to have the resilience to hang in there. ""The resilience he has shown to have a few setbacks but to keep on fighting and coming back stronger each and every time says a lot about him. We're delighted for all three of them.""These comments are now closed."
157,Sri Lanka top group after beating Bangladesh,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64617525,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section CricketSri Lanka made it two wins from two at the Women's T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket win against Bangladesh.Sri Lanka, who shocked hosts South Africa on Friday, slipped to 25-3 in pursuit of 127 amid an inspired opening spell from 18-year-old Marufa Akter.But Harshitha Madavi hit 69 not out and Nilakshi de Silva an unbeaten 41 to secure victory with 10 balls to spare.Sri Lanka had earlier made a ragged start with the ball before recovering to restrict the Tigers to 126-8.Bangladesh capitalised on wayward bowling in the powerplay to reach 64-2 from eight overs but their scoring ground to a halt after Sobhana Mostary was bowled by a visibly frustrated Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Athapaththu, who attempted a Mankad earlier in the over.Athapaththu, Sri Lanka's top scorer with 68 against the Proteas, was caught at mid-on for 15 off Akter in the fourth over of Sri Lanka's chase - the seamer's opening spell the first moment of real quality in a match previously littered with mistakes by both sides.She had Vishmi Gunaratne caught behind and bowled Anushka Sanjeewani first ball, giving her figures of 3-0 after 1.3 overs.But Harshitha and De Silva remained calm under pressure with a composed stand of 104, which first halted the Tigers' momentum and then clinically finished the match.With 41 from 30 balls needed, Harshitha cut a no-ball for four before swinging a big six over the leg side off the subsequent free hit.The win means Sri Lanka, who play Australia on Thursday, will likely reach their first World Cup semi-final if they beat New Zealand in their final group game. Even if they lose they could still go through if other results go their way.Bangladesh are fourth in Group A and play Australia in their second match on Tuesday."

162,Scotland beat Wales to end Gatland hoodoo,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64613056,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Rugby Unioncomments2492A Finn Russell-inspired Scotland earned a record victory against Wales to continue a stunning start to their Six Nations with two wins from two.Two Russell penalties and a converted George Turner try saw Gregor Townsend's side race into a 13-0 lead, before Wales hit back through Ken Owens. Kyle Steyn crossed twice in the second half before Blair Kinghorn's superb score and Matt Fagerson's late try.It ended their Warren Gatland hoodoo and will have fans daring to dream.For Wales, it was a second defeat in a row after slumping to a 34-10 loss to Ireland.Wales had their chances to score in the opening half, but failed to take advantage of all their possession and territory. How they suffered for it. This wasn't just an end to Gatland's dominance over Scotland that stretches back 11 Tests, it was an utter deconstruction, principally in a second half where Scotland attacked in devastating wave after devastating wave.They took a while to find their ruthlessness, but once they hit their stride, guided by the mesmeric Russell, they stormed away to win and are now two wins from two for the first time in the history of the Six Nations. France to come in Paris in a fortnight. Scotland will believe that anything is possible right now.They had a 6-0 lead early on through two Russell penalties, but for much of the opening 40 it was Wales who were in control. Behind on the scoreboard, but on top in pretty much every other sense.They were undone by their own lack of accuracy and by Scotland's desperate scrambling. They had a lineout five metres from the home line but the towering Richie Gray pinched it. They had a scrum five metres out but their backline came up offside and the chance went.Dan Biggar had a shot at goal. A long way out, for sure, but how many times has he nailed such kicks? He missed. They had another attacking lineout after Russell's restart went out on the full, but when they looked menacing, Jamie Ritchie pilfered it on the floor. Then, of course, Wales conceded. All those promising moments, but it was Scotland who landed the first heavy blow.It was Turner who drove powerfully through the Wales cover off a lineout maul, a thumping finish from a hooker growing every week in stature. Russell's conversion made it 13-0, but there was drama to come directly after. Scotland messed up at the restart, Wales attacked and Turner came steaming in a little high on George North. He got binned and in his absence, Owens piled over from close range for a score that Wales clearly deserved.The half didn't end without another bout of painful Welsh profligacy when Rio Dyer spilled it on the left wing with the Scottish line at his mercy. They had 70% territory in that opening half and had done most of the attacking, but trailed by six at the break.They were to pay for their wastefulness because Scotland came out with a different mindset. They survived the remaining minutes of the Turner yellow and then went after their visitors. Kinghorn, who had come on early after a Stuart Hogg head injury assessment, came into it. Duhan van der Merwe, hushed to this point, started to fire up his engines. Turner came within a whisker of scoring his second, but Scotland didn't have to wait for long. Piling pressure on, and forcing penalties, they put Wales where they didn't want to be. When the next chance came, Russell's half-break through the gap and his sumptuous offload close to the right wing put Steyn in. A glorious moment from the fly-half, who then walloped over the conversion from the touchline. They turned the screw from there. More pressure and a yellow card for Liam Williams for persistent offending. They could have taken a simple three points, but gambled, went for touch on the left, then Russell cross-kicked expertly to the right and Steyn caught and scored. Suddenly, from being a close affair it was an 18-point game.Scotland continued to unload, the beautiful execution we saw from them last week now laying waste again. Kinghorn got the bonus point try that had its beginnings in a huge forwards maul before Russell cross-kicked again with gorgeous accuracy. Van der Merwe claimed it and fed Kinghorn, who ran away to score. Thirty points now. A rout. And there was more. Russell, utterly unplayable by now, pulled all the strings once more, flinging a precise pass over the heads of the retreating defence to the mighty Fagerson to touch down in the corner. Thirty-five points. Better than the wildest dream of the most ardent Scottish fan.We wondered if Scotland could handle the pressure of finally backing up one win with another. We pondered if they were actually the real deal or not. The answer came, in the most emphatic style.  Former Scotland captain John Barclay on BBC One: ""There was a maturity and a clear change of tactic second half and the ability to implement that. They kicked it long, put pressure on Wales. Same as last week, their ability to execute under pressure was brilliant.That allows players like Finn Russell, Duhan van der Merwe grow in the game. The most pleasing thing was their ability to get into the sheds at half-time and grab that game by the scruff off the neck.""Former Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies on BBC One: ""The effort was there and the youngsters stood up. They're the future for Wales.""My problem is the lack of creativity behind and that's been a problem for a number of years.""Today they were one-dimensional, not accurate and slightly clueless if we're being honest. That is what Wales must work on now.""Scotland: 15-Hogg; 14-Steyn, 13-Jones, 12-Tuipulotu, 11-Van der Merwe; 10-Russell, 9-White; 1-Schoeman, 2-Turner, 3-Z. Fagerson, 4-R.

167,GB beat Portugal to reach EuroBasket finals,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/basketball/64619042,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section BasketballGreat Britain secured a place at June's EuroBasket finals by beating Portugal 78-48 in their last Group G qualifier.With only four runners-up qualifying spots on offer across the 10 groups, Britain needed a convincing win and for other results to go their way.They withstood Portugal's good start for a second dominant win in four days, having beaten Estonia on Thursday. Temi Fagbenle led Britain's scoring with 17 points, while Cheridene Green added 15 and Georgia Gayle 14. In total, there will be 16 teams at the EuroBasket finals, with co-hosts Slovenia and Israel qualifying automatically. The 14 other places were to be taken by the 10 qualifying group winners and the four best runners-up - and so to ensure their spot, Britain needed a big winning margin.Britain took the lead for the first time after four minutes of play but struggled against the intense pressure Portugal put on the ball carriers, who had seen playmaker Kennedy Leonard go off after 22 seconds with a hand injury.In the second quarter, GB more than matched that intensity and went on a 19-7 run to lead by 12 points at the interval, a margin that at least offered a chance of qualification. Hannah Robb and Green produced energy in the late third quarter as Britain extended the lead while Fagbenle took a break. GB went 30 points in front early in the fourth quarter and never looked likely to take their foot off the pedal.""We knew it was going to be intense and physical,"" said GB captain Chantelle Handy after the game. ""They had a bit of chip on their shoulder after we beat them in overtime last time.""""We know they're the type of team that can shoot themselves back into a game. So we definitely keep our foot on the pedal.""Handy also announced her retirement from international basketball after making he 140th appearance for the team, along with fellow Olympian Azania Stewart.

Conor Owens missed the chance to get Omagh on the scoreboard before Lawn scored an excellent goal in the sixth minute, collecting the ball after a fine passing moved and making a strong run through the middle before showing excellent composure to deliver a cool finish past the outrushing keeper Conor McAneney.The excellent McCullagh got the first of his points to open Omagh's account on eight minutes and Haigney soon built on that with a well-taken point three minutes later.Owens made up for his earlier missed free with an excellent point before his team-mate Liam Og Mossey was denied a goal by a good save from Ruairi Dillon after a clever soccer-style move created the chance. It was a sign that Omagh were starting to grow into the game after a slow start and, indeed, they took the lead for the first time in the match on 22 minutes through a McCullagh point and extended the gap to three points with scores from captain Eoin McElholm and another one from McCullagh.However, the sides almost went in level at half time after a long ball into the Omagh goalmouth found Martin, who fisted towards goal from point-blank range but somehow McAneney got his hand up to make an excellent save.  Omagh looked more and more comfortable in the second half and Caolan Donnelly almost scored what would have been an outstanding goal, but saw his shot saved after orchestrating a superb passing move from deep in his own half.Brian Hampsey tried to rally Holy Trinity with an excellent point from distance on 45 minutes but when Martin went for goal from an easy free rather than taking his point, it was a clear sign that Omagh were on course for what was the fifth MacRory Cup triumph in their history."

""The crisis the North West 200 and the rest of motorcycle sport in Ireland currently faces is due to a huge increase in the cost of insurance cover for 2023,"" confirmed a statement from the NW200 organisers on Friday.""The Coleraine and District Motor Club has been working tirelessly to mitigate the pressure created by these extra costs. ""The club was confident it could manage the initial premium increase, but with other events unable to do so the transfer of extra charges to the North West 200 created an unsustainable financial burden.""The organisers of the NW200 have not given up the fight. We cannot afford to lose an event that has been running for over 90 years and plays such a vital role in the economy of the north coast area.""We have been overwhelmed by the messages and offers of support we have received today and whilst we understand the decision taken by the MCUI (UC), the Coleraine and District Motor club will continue in its efforts to stage the North West 200 on May 7-13. ""Plans were already in place to welcome new competitors to the event during an induction day next Tuesday, 14 February. Both that event and the Meet the Stars race launch, scheduled for 15 February, will go ahead as planned and we will continue to keep everyone informed of our progress."""
184,What can be done about racism in Spanish football?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64597323,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section European FootballSpanish football is facing a major issue with racism. Vinicius Jr alone has been the target of alleged racial abuse five times this season. According to Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague, ""not one person in Spain has been sentenced or punished for a racist incident related to football"".Have we now reached a ""turning point"" though? Real Madrid's Brazilian winger has repeatedly called for the authorities to clamp down, with Mallorca fans at least the third group of supporters this season to racially abuse the 22-year-old.In September he was compared to a monkey on Spanish TV. Last month an effigy was hung from a motorway bridge near Real's training ground. La Liga says it frequently passes racism cases onto local public prosecutors - but cannot take action itself.Unlike other football authorities, La Liga says it cannot dish out punishments for racism from fans on its own.In England, the Premier League can ban anyone found to have behaved in a discriminatory or abusive way.Uefa and Fifa both punish teams for racial abuse from their fans - even if many think their punishments do not go far enough.Spanish sides Atletico Madrid - with a section of their ground closed - and Sevilla - with a 5,000 euros fine - were both punished by Uefa after Champions League games against Manchester City last year.But all La Liga can do is file reports to various legal bodies - and none have ever ended in a prosecution.""Surely there must be mechanisms within football - either La Liga or the Spanish FA - to say if the crowd misbehaves and the officials hear this there can be a punishment, the game can be abandoned, clubs can be fined,"" said Raphael Honigstein on the BBC Euro Leagues podcast. ""There must be a sporting mechanism to deal with this. I don't understand how La Liga say we referred them to the public prosecutors but unfortunately we didn't hear anything so that's all we can do. It doesn't seem a very satisfactory answer.""Balague said: ""I do believe La Liga when they say they can't do any more because it's not in their realms, they haven't got the authority to do it. But the other authorities should change their tune. ""La Liga reports those insults to the public prosecutors office and that can take it into a civil court case. They can also report it to the state commission against violence, racism, xenophobia and intolerance.""They can go to the competition committee as well. That depends on the federation. There hasn't been any powerful steps from the competition committee to tackle this.""The rules are very clear, if they [authorities] have enough evidence they can go and punish somebody but in a lot of cases they say they don't know who did it, they don't have enough information, enough evidence so shelf the cases.""La Liga has recently highlighted six cases and their latest legal status...""Prosecutors have to do better,"" said European football journalist Julien Laurens. ""It's like they try to find excuses to let people off. It's not enough.""Balague added: ""If feels like something is changing because this week a procedure has started against fans by their own club. Valladolid said this is related to racist insults to Vinicius and told 10 fans that they will be banned.""But the club describe these as isolated cases and also add it doesn't mean the fans are racist. That is deep down the problem.""There are plenty of instances of racism in Spanish football but so many seem to centre around Vinicius, one of La Liga's best players.He has scored 32 goals and made 17 assists in 137 La Liga appearances, helping Real Madrid win the league title twice and Champions League once.""Vinicius is the victim of something that I don't understand. It must be solved,"" said his boss Carlo Ancelotti.""It seems that the problem is Vinicius, and it is not like that.""A panellist on a Spanish football show earlier this season compared his goal celebrations to a monkey. Vinicius released a video statement in response to the ""xenophobic and racist"" insult, saying he ""won't stop dancing"" and ""the happiness of a black Brazilian being successful in Europe bothers"" many people.On the latest incidents, Laurens said: ""This has to be a turning point. I don't remember any other players in the modern era who have been targeted as much as Vini on the pitch by defenders but more importantly off the pitch by opposition fans. It's disgusting.""Balague said: ""The media have not treated the whole thing seriously. They have made it part of a debate, like 'is Vinicius to blame for what is happening to him? Is his dribbling and provocation causing the rise of racist incidents in stadiums?' That is not the debate that should be happening.""Those who say it's down to Vinicius, they look at stats and say look he hasn't scored in nine games, he plays badly when he's provoked and all the players and fans are doing is provoking him to get a lesser version of Vinicius. ""What an awful thing to say - saying everything is allowed for that to happen, including racial insults.""Racism in football is far from isolated though - and is always a branch of the racism which exists in society.""Apart from the work La Liga is doing I don't think there is a real interest from anyone to fight against this open and clearly. Socially it doesn't feel like an urgent thing to do,"" said Balague, who is Spanish.""There's not a feeling on the streets of Spain this is an urgent matter. Many blame Vinicius for what's happening.""Why don't sports media [in Spain] take this seriously? Generally because football media don't see football and sport a serious matter. It's a cartoonish thing you can debate. ""You defend one team. If you're a Real Madrid journalist you go against Barcelona. The debates are really extreme. There is no intention of taking this out of the sports arena and study this properly.""In the UK it is a daily debate and discussion - at some point on radio or television - it's there. It doesn't happen in Spain or Italy.  ""No country is perfect. It's a daily fight that will be fought forever. It feels like discrimination is ever-present. I'd like us to take a lot of learning from what has happened in the UK and what is happening in France."" Laurens said: ""It has to be a joint effort. It has to be La Liga and the government, it has to go through education. Go to school and educate children about racism and what it is to have a different skin colour. All of that has to be there for the next generation not to repeat what we see now."""
185,Team Taylor to hold talks with McGregor on Monday,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/64588245,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section BoxingPromoter Eddie Hearn will talk with Conor McGregor on Monday in Dublin over a last-gasp deal for Katie Taylor's dream Croke Park homecoming on 20 May.MMA star McGregor offered to sponsor Taylor's rematch against Amanda Serrano after Hearn walked away from staging it at the 82,300-capacity stadium on 20 May because of the security costs.Hearn insisted talks with Ireland's McGregor were not a ""publicity stunt"". ""I'm talking to Conor about potentially bridging that gap,"" he said.""But more importantly looking at why the costs are so high, can we overcome them in May, or can we all work together to do the first fight at the 3Arena, and then a September fight at Croke Park. whether that's Taylor-Serrano 3 or more than likely Chantelle Cameron.""Our date is 20 May which is immovable because it's built around the (broadcast partner) DAZN schedule. ""So maybe that is at the 3Arena then in September we go to Croke Park.""The stage looked to be set for the five-time world amateur champion, Olympic gold medallist and now unified lightweight champion Taylor to finally box in Ireland for the first time as a professional, at a huge outdoor event pencilled in at Croke Park, the headquarters of Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).A rematch with newly crowned undisputed featherweight champion Serrano had been agreed but the plans received a significant blow when Hearn, Taylor's promoter, was told the price to hire Croke Park could be as much as ¬£1.2m.Hearn says that would mean it would be a loss-leading event unless Taylor took a huge cut in earnings from the contest.""It's not just a case of Katie deserves it, pay it,"" Hearn said.""I'm not going to Katie Taylor and telling her she needs to take a pay cut to go to Croke Park. I want her to make as much money as possible.""But I'm not only talking about the rental charge here. ""I'm saying that the costs that Croke Park have told us we have to take care of are three times more than the costs of Wembley. ""You do generally pay for security but stewarding might be supplied by the stadium. ""The laying of the pitch, etc. It's approximately ‚Ç¨1.3-1.4m (¬£1.2m) in costs to stage it there. Wembley, for example, is about ¬£400k.""Hearn, instead, made an alternative plan for the fight to head to Dublin's 3Arena on the same date, at a significantly lower price but with only 10,000 seats available to sell.Former UFC champion McGregor, meanwhile, had been keeping up to date with the developments and suggested on Twitter that he could plug the financial hole. Hearn and McGregor have since been in regular contact via Twitter messages and now the Matchroom boss says he intends to fly to Dublin on Monday to formulate a plan - although it may mean Taylor's Croke Park outing will have to wait until the summer.""He loves Katie Taylor and he would love to help get it at Croke Park,"" Hearn said of McGregor.""I haven't given up but there is probably a ¬£600,000-¬£700,000 deficit of where we need to be. Maybe he can fill that."""
186,Debutant Murphy takes five wickets but India on top,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64595968,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Cricketcomments302Spinner Todd Murphy took five wickets on his Australia debut but Rohit Sharma's century helped India build a big lead on day two of the first Test.Rohit hit a classy 120 as the hosts closed on 321-7 in Nagpur, leading by 144 despite off-spinner Murphy's 5-82.India were 229-6, just 52 ahead, when Rohit was bowled by Pat Cummins after tea but Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel then put on an unbroken stand of 81.Jadeja, who took 5-47 on day one, ended on 66 not out and Patel unbeaten on 52.Murphy caught and bowled KL Rahul on day one for his maiden Test wicket and took the first three to fall on the second day, including Virat Kohli taken down the leg side for 12.The 22-year-old dismissed fellow debutant Srikar Bharat lbw on review to clinch his five-wicket haul - his first in any form of senior professional cricket.Steve Smith dropped three catches during the day, including Jadeja off the penultimate ball of the final session.Australia will fear India's lead, built in response to the visitors being dismissed for 177, could already be decisive on a turning pitch that is expected to deteriorate further throughout the match.Murphy, who had only played seven first-class matches before his Test debut, bowled with impressive accuracy throughout his 36 overs - the highest number he has ever bowled in a senior match - and extracted notable turn from the Nagpur pitch.He also dismissed Ravichandran Ashwin lbw and had Cheteshwar Pujara caught at short fine leg.The Victorian - he was born in the small, rural town of Echuca - has already been tipped as the heir to senior spinner Nathan Lyon during his short career.He did not start bowling off-spin until he was 16 but has represented Australia Under-19s and went on a tour of Sri Lanka with the A side.Preferred to fellow spinners Mitchell Swepson and Ashton Agar in Nagpur, Murphy's action and quick approach to the crease has drawn comparisons to former England off-spinner Graeme Swann.These comments are now closed."
187,Dubois can win world title right now - Azim,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/64543498,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section BoxingCaroline Dubois and Adam Azim are two of Britain's brightest prospects and have been in lockstep since they were 10 years old. They were both amateur stars from the same boxing club and now, as professionals, they train under coach Shane McGuigan and are tipped to reach the very top. ""Caroline can win a world title right now,"" says Azim, 20.Their paths first crossed more than a decade ago at Dale Youth Boxing Academy, which then sat beneath London's Grenfell Tower. ""I knew back then Adam was going to be special,"" Dubois recalls. ""I was around 11 years old and Adam must have been 10 years old. I was bigger and taller than him back then and we used to have really competitive sparring."" Slough's Azim, whose amateur career includes 10 national titles, remembers Dubois' early promise. ""She could really whack,"" he says. ""She was very powerful, very skilful and very strong. ""It's funny because we're all still together at McGuigan's gym; me, my brother Hassan, Caroline Dubois, Daniel Dubois. ""It's like being back in the Dale Youth days. It was an incredible club.""Dale Youth Boxing Academy has produced several professional fighters and, as a result, Azim and Dubois were never short on role models. ""Caroline's brother Daniel Dubois was the star at Dale Youth when I was there, he always used to knock people out, I looked up to him a lot,"" says Azim. Caroline, meanwhile, idolised another of the academy's famous sons. ""I used to love James DeGale,"" the 22-year-old says. ""I remember when he first walked into the gym and I thought, 'Oh my god - celebrity moment'. ""Obviously, George Groves came from Dale Youth too. It was a very good club.""On 14 June 2017, Dale Youth, situated in the basement of Grenfell Tower in west London, was destroyed in one of the UK's worst fire disasters. Among the 72 fatalities was Dubois' trainer, Tony Disson.""Tony was in the corner of my first ever fight, he was one of my coaches. I remember coming home and it was all over the news. My thought was, is Tony in the tower? And he was. So many people died. It was horrible,"" says Dubois. Azim and Dubois, against the backdrop of this unimaginable tragedy, continued to progress. Following in the footsteps of their Dale Youth heroes they became decorated amateur champions.  Now fledgling professionals and described by their promoter Ben Shalom as the future faces of British boxing, both fighters are conscious of keeping their feet on the floor.""I embrace being called a future star,"" Dubois says. ""But with it there's a responsibility. You can't just expect to be great and not train, you have to back it up and work hard.""I'm my own worst critic at times because I'm aiming so high in my head. Every time I'm in the gym and I'm not performing 100%, that bugs me. That's what keeps me grounded.""Azim echoes Dubois' humility: ""I'm just a normal kid trying to achieve a goal. ""I'll always remain the same. I'm never that person with a high ego, I just want to stay grounded and work hard. ""It comes from my dad. He brought me up well.""On Saturday night at London's Wembley Arena, Azim and Dubois will write the latest chapter of their inseparable story. Azim tops the bill against Nicaraguan Santos Reyes, while Dubois faces Feriche Mashaury from Tanzania. ""She's mature and experienced,"" says Dubois. ""If this fight goes well then it's a step up again. I can't go backward. I'm aiming for the sky and above. ""That's what separates me from other fighters that have turned pro. ""Most are sitting around fiddling their thumbs and enjoying the limelight. I want to keep striving forward."" For Azim, he aims to add to his six-fight knockout streak against Reyes.""Reyes is durable and strong,"" says Azim. ""He's going to come and give it a go. I don't underestimate anyone, he's trying to stop me from reaching my world title glory.""I want to become a world champion before I'm 22 years old. ""Amir Khan did it at 22 years old. Khan inspired me to get where I am, and for me to be 21 years old and world champion, no-one has done that in England.""Dubois, who has trained alongside Azim since he was barely tall enough to climb into a boxing ring, is backing him to fulfil his dream. ""Adam was always a very special fighter, he's got his family supporting him, he's unbelievably dedicated and he's going all the way to the top.""Returning the compliment to his old sparring partner, Azim predicts Dubois will reach the pinnacle of the sport sooner rather than later.""Every time I come to the gym I tell Caroline she's going to be the best female boxer in the country,"" he says. ""She beats anyone at her weight right now."""
188,Russian Olympic participation 'can't be covered up',https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/64604212,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section OlympicsRussian participation in the Paris 2024 Olympics ""cannot be covered up with pretend neutrality or a white flag"", Ukraine president Volodymr Zelensky says.Zelensky was speaking at a summit of 36 nations on Friday to discuss Russian and Belarusian athletes' participation in next year's Games.The summit was chaired by UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer.A collective statement is expected to be agreed in the coming days.The summit was called after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was ""exploring a pathway"" for athletes from the two nations to compete as neutrals.That move has been criticised amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.Speaking via live video link, Zelensky told the delegation: ""While Russia kills and terrorises, representatives of the terrorist state have no place at sports and Olympic competitions.""And it cannot be covered up with some pretended neutrality or a white flag, because Russia is now a country that stains everything with blood - even the white flag. ""It must be recognised. And this must be recognised, in particular, at the level of the International Olympic Committee.""Russian sports minister Oleg Matytsin said calls to ban their athletes from the Olympics were unacceptable.In his opening address, Zelensky told the delegation - which included ministers and senior representatives from countries including France, Germany, Poland, the United States and Canada - that 228 Ukrainian athletes and coaches had died since Russia's invasion in February 2022.He called for the Olympic movement to be ""safeguarded"", noting that ""many Russian athletes are associated with the sports clubs of the Russian army and security state agencies"".""If the Olympic sports were killings and missile strikes, then you know which national team would occupy the first place,"" he said.He later added: ""If, God forbid, the Olympic principles are destroyed and Russian athletes are allowed to participate in any competitions or the Olympic Games, it's just a matter of time before the terrorist state forces them to play along with the war propaganda.""In January, the IOC suggested Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete under neutral flags in Paris, saying ""no athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport"".Ukraine's sports minister Vadym Guttsait has said the country could boycott the Olympics if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete.A large number of other nations have already voiced their opposition to the potential inclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes.""Now we see an undisguised desire to destroy the unity of international sports and the international Olympic movement, to make sport a means of pressure to resolve political issues,"" Russian minister Matytsin told state news agency Tass.""This is a direct interference of ministers in the activities of independent international sports organisations, an attempt to dictate the conditions for the participation of athletes in international competitions, which is absolutely unacceptable.""On Thursday, the IOC urged Ukraine to drop threats of boycotting the Games in Paris.In a letter to Guttsait, which has been seen by the BBC, IOC president Thomas Bach said comments from Ukrainian officials suggesting allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes would promote the war are ""defamatory"".""Russia has destroyed Ukrainian sporting infrastructure and stopped opportunities for Ukrainian athletes,"" Frazer told the summit.""There is danger here that the world wishes to move on and back to business as usual. However, the situation in Ukraine has not changed since the IOC's initial decision last February on banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition.  ""As long as Putin continues his war, Russia and Belarus must not be allowed to compete on the world stage or be represented at the Olympics."""

190,Larne beat Glenavon to go top as Carrick secure win,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64600076,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section IrishLarne returned to the top of the Irish Premiership table thanks to a routine 3-0 win over Glenavon at Inver Park. Leroy Millar's first-half double and a second-half strike from Lee Bonis was enough to see the Inver side return to the summit on goal difference.In the other Friday night game, two goals from Emmet McGuckin helped Carrick Rangers to a 2-0 victory away to 10-man Newry City. The win enabled Stuart King's side to leapfrog Glenavon into eighth position. Two composed finishes ifrom Millar put Larne in the driving seat at the break. After a quiet start to the game, the midfielder gave the hosts the lead on the 14th minute as the former Ballymena United man raced clear of the Glenavon defence to latch onto Andrew Ryan's pass and calmly slot home the opener. Millar would double his and Larne's tally for the evening four minutes before the interval after again bursting from midfield, this time onto Lee Bonis cushioned pass, before emphatically firing past a helpless Rory Brown for his 10th goal of the season. Millar was injured in scoring the second goal and was replaced at the break, although he was seen on the bench with ice around a potential ankle problem.Glenavon had chances of their own in the first period, with an unmarked Callum Birney heading wide from Jamie Doran's corner and Matthew Fitzpatrick firing wide from close range. Gary Hamilton's men pushed forward in the second half in an attempt get back into the game, but were unable to create any clear-cut opportunities for all their efforts. The closest the Lurgan Blues came to a goal was Conor Kerr's overhit cross clipping the upright and Issac Baird being denied from a tight angle inside the Larne penalty area. Tiernan Lynch's men soaked up the Glenavon pressure and after a formation tweak, capitalised to add a third with a devastating counter-attack.Bonis secured the three points in the 76th minute, as Larne's top scorer raced onto Tomas Cosgrove's throughball before firing home into the far corner, off the inside of the post. The win is Larne's second consecutive home victory, whilst Glenavon remain winless on their travels since August. A goal in each half from Emmet McGuckin ensured Carrick Rangers were able to take full advantage of Glenavon's defeat to Larne and move to within two points of Ballymena, who occupy the final European play-off spot. The striker fired home an unstoppable volley to open the scoring in the 27th minute after he connected with Alex Gawne's looping pass.Despite falling behind, Newry created the majority of the chances in the opening 45 minutes. Their best opportunity arrived when Thomas Lockhart played an inviting pass across the face of goal and Philip Donnelly blasted wide when he looked destined to find the back of the net. James Teelan also had a good chance, but his strong strike from distance curled wide of the left-hand post.Newry were punished for their wasteful finishing as McGuckin got his second of the evening soon after the restart. The away side capitalised on a mistake by Newry goalkeeper Steven Maguire. His attempted clearance fell to Carrick's Nedas Maciulaitis, who then played a lovely through ball to Ben Tilney, and McGuckin tucked home from the full-back's low cross.The visitors dominated proceedings in the second half. Lloyd Anderson went close to adding a third seconds after Carrick's second goal, but his strike from distance was off target. Shortly after that a superb save from Maguire prevented Tilney from scoring, after the ex-Larne player drove through midfield and struck from just inside the box.Things went from bad to worse for Darren Mullen's side in the 80th minute when Daniel Hughes received his second yellow after a late tackle on Tilney in midfield.The result means that Newry remain perilously positioned just above the drop zone, three points ahead of Dungannon Swifts, who are 11th in the table."

""The emotional side is difficult to predict how I'll feel walking out into a stadium I know so well and so many people I know so well. ""For the moment, we are preparing the game as we would any other Premier League game.""Bournemouth went from the lower reaches of League Two to become an established Premier League team under Howe, who guided them to three promotions in six seasons.They spent five seasons in the top flight before being relegated in 2020.Howe also spent almost his entire playing career with the Cherries, making over 300 appearances in two spells before joining the coaching staff.His assistant at Newcastle, Jason Tindall, took over as Cherries boss after Howe's departure before he was sacked in February 2021.Bournemouth boss Gary O'Neil said he was sure the club and its fans will give Howe ""the welcome he deserves for the work he did"" but it will be ""business as usual"" by the time the match kicks off.Striker Callum Wilson joined Newcastle from Bournemouth in September 2020 and, while he says he will be doing his best to score, added that he will not celebrate if he does so.""I feel like they gave me an unbelievable opportunity to play and progress my career, so to celebrate in front of their fans against the team that means so much to them would be a bit disrespectful,"" Wilson told the Footballer's Football podcast.Fourth-placed Newcastle go into the game trying to further their claim for a Champions League spot, while Bournemouth are 19th as they try to avoid the drop. ""It's very important that we don't look at that,"" said Howe. ""Let's look at what they have done in recent weeks. ""They have signed some very good players, invested in the transfer market. This is a different Bournemouth team to the one we have seen in previous weeks. ""They are very athletic, there is a lot of pace all through the team. This is a different game and we need to be ready for what's ahead.""The Magpies are unbeaten in their last 16 Premier League games but have drawn four of their last five in that run.""We're desperate to win. We want momentum in our season, we don't want any kind of lull,"" added Howe.""We are 16 games unbeaten and we have to be positive but we need to win.""Newcastle have top-flight games against Bournemouth and Liverpool before playing Manchester United in the Carabao Cup final on 26 February.Howe says he has ""banned"" talk about the final at home. ""The final is two weeks and there are two games [beforehand],"" he said. ""I'm not thinking about the final at all other than probably like everyone else around Newcastle with tickets. That's the big word all around the city at the moment. ""I've had requests from all kinds of people, random text messages from people whose number I don't know.

196,Wales' Biggar says pressure is all on Scotland,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64594064,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Welsh RugbyWales fly-half Dan Biggar says the pressure is on Scotland in Saturday's Six Nations game at Murrayfield.Scotland defeated England at Twickenham in the opening round of matches, while Wales were heavily beaten by Ireland.Biggar believes Wales are not given the respect their Six Nations record deserves, while Scotland are lauded.""Scotland played well last week against England, but according to you guys [media] they are the best team around, aren't they?"" said Biggar.The 33-year-old was in combative mood in his pre-match news conference, claiming there would have been no point in the Wales squad catching their flight to Edinburgh if they had been engulfed by media hype surrounding ""the best team in the tournament"", referring to Scotland.Wales have burst Scotland's bubble in the past two years. In 2021, Wayne Pivac's side went to Murrayfield and beat Scotland a week after the Scots toppled England at Twickenham.Last season, Biggar and company triumphed in Cardiff seven days on from Gregor Townsend's side retaining the Calcutta Cup, with the Wales fly-half kicking the winning drop-goal.So Scotland will be hoping it is third time lucky as they aim to win their opening two Six Nations games for a first time in the tournament's 23-year history.Since 2000, Wales' overall Six Nations record of six titles, four Grand Slams and five Triple Crowns is a total no country can match.In contrast, Scotland last won the competition in 1999 when it was the final Five Nations tournament and this weekend's hosts have not triumphed in the opening two games since 1996.""We will have to see how they go on Saturday, see if they can back it up,"" said Toulon's Biggar.""The pressure is all on them. They are red-hot favourites, best team in the tournament, so we will see how they go [on] Saturday. ""We don't seem to get any credit, and other teams seem to get a lot of praise for probably not quite the success we've had, but that's how it goes.""I think our record is as good as anyone's in this competition over the previous 10 years or whatever.""Medals are important when you look back at your career, and we have been lucky enough to fill the cabinet a few times.""It is up to other teams to try and replicate that really. Hopefully, if teams do that, then they will deservedly get praise.""Wales' recent record is not so impressive having lost 10 out of the past 13 games and starting the 2023 campaign with a heaviest home defeat by Ireland in 22 years.They have fallen to ninth in the world rankings, while Scotland have risen to fifth.""If you listen to everyone - which is what is great about this game - we might as well not have bothered catching the flight,"" said Biggar.""In Wales, you lose a game, you get criticised; you win, it is just sort of brushed over.""It is one of those things where we just try and control what we can, but we do have a bit of a laugh that there are other teams around who get a fair bit of praise without really backing it up, I suppose.""It is a really difficult ask, but I think this country and this group of boys tend to respond well to when our backs are against the wall and we have got to come out fighting.""They [Scotland] are a fantastic team at the minute playing with confidence, lots of good players.""They will fancy their chances, they have picked a strong side, lots of good players who played well last week and they will be full of confidence.""But it was the same last year. We got off to a really slow start in Ireland and then played Scotland - you guys [the media] wrote us off before the game was played and we rolled our sleeves up and did a job.""So recent history backs Wales, while form favours Scotland.Wales have won on six of their past seven visits to Murrayfield, with an overall success-rate of 85% across the countries' past 20 encounters, home and away.And Warren Gatland has never been on the losing side against Scotland as Wales head coach, posting an unblemished record of 11 wins during his first stint as Wales boss between 2008 and 2019.""It is not just Warren's record, we have got a good record as a team,"" said Biggar.""I am not sure we can put our fingers on it. It's one of those where what Warren does is instil a lot of belief in his players, in the teams he coaches; he always gives you confidence that whoever you are playing you are going to win.""So if we have got a good record against someone we tend to know what works against them.

203,From castrating bulls to Super Bowl - meet the Kelce brothers (and mum),https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/64514276,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section American FootballJason and Travis Kelce started the season talking about castrating bulls on their new podcast.They will end it by making NFL history in Super Bowl 57 on Sunday.In a ""mind-boggling"" scenario, when Jason's Philadelphia Eagles face Travis' Kansas City Chiefs it will be the first time that brothers play against each other in the NFL's championship game.""You realise it could happen, I don't think we ever thought it would though,"" said Jason. ""It's got to be a lottery pick kind of probability.""During Super Bowl week in Phoenix, their mother Donna has become arguably as famous as her sons, speaking to media from around the world about the 'Kelce Bowl'.And if the story was not already surreal enough, there could be another addition to the family this weekend.Jason and Travis Kelce have both been in the NFL for at least 10 years now, winning one Super Bowl each.They have each had numerous Pro Bowl selections, meaning they are the NFL's best in their positions - centre and tight end, respectively.But last summer they wanted to start a new venture, a podcast named New Heights after Cleveland Heights, the suburb where they grew up in Cleveland, Ohio.On the first episode, Jason talks about getting very hands on with some cows he purchased last summer. That set the tone, and the topics have got more random while the brothers have got more relaxed.New Heights is about football, family and fun, and it was one of the most popular podcasts in the US even before talk of the 'Kelce Bowl'.On last week's episode Jason said he was ""already over it"" and they tried to play it down. But now they have fully embraced the media circus.They are selling 'Kelce Bowl' merchandise and recorded the latest episode on 'radio row', where media broadcast around the clock during Super Bowl week.At 35, Jason is two years older and in another episode Travis remembered how, when growing up, his big brother once body slammed him through a wooden floor in their living room.To avoid getting caught immediately, they covered the hole with their couch. Boys will be boys.Travis has been surprised that most of the questions during the numerous media opportunities this week have been about who won the most fights growing up.""Jason won every fight but one - and that was the last one!"" he said. ""He stopped fighting me after that.""That must have been when a sudden growth spurt meant Travis catch up with his older brother.""It hit like lightning,"" said Jason. ""Overnight, he went from an uncoordinated Bambi to a full blown stallion. I was like 'where did Seabiscuit come from?'""At 6ft 5in, Travis is now two inches taller but Jason has a more stocky frame, weighing 134kg while Travis is 113kg. Jason's main job is to block the opposition and he accepts Travis has always been the more gifted athlete.Sadly, there will be no repeat of their boyhood battles on Sunday. They both play on offence so will never be on the field at the same time.The brothers credit their father Ed for giving them a love for sport - and their thick eyebrows. Ed paid for them to try several sports before settling on football, and they played on the same college team at the University of Cincinnati.Since coming into the NFL they have been one-team men, and mother Donna has been their biggest fan.During last season's play-offs they played on the same day but hours apart so Donna watched the Eagles lose at Tampa Bay before flying 1,200 miles to Kansas City to see the Chiefs beat Pittsburgh. The NFL tweeted progress reports on her journey and during the Chiefs' post-match news conference she asked Travis about making the only touchdown pass of his career during that game.But Travis accepts that, right now, Jason is her favourite, and Donna admits it too. That is because Jason and his wife Kylie have given her two grandchildren - and there is another on the way.Kylie is 38 weeks pregnant and will be accompanied by her nurse at the game in Phoenix. If she goes into labour during the Super Bowl, the NFL's medical staff have said they can deliver the baby at the State Farm Stadium.And if so, Kylie has said that she and Jason have considered giving the baby the initials SB.Super Bowl week begins with Opening Night, a fun media event where players are asked all sorts of questions.Wearing a half-and-half jersey made from Chiefs and Eagles shirts, Donna joined her boys on stage and presented each with a box of homemade cookies.She also answered questions about them by lifting paddles with their face on. Apparently younger brother Travis is the biggest mummy's boy.Donna has been a regular in the media centre all week, wearing a half-and-half denim jacket and chatting with as many reporters as she can. She also took part in Roger Goodell's news conference, asking the NFL commissioner if he will go on her boys' podcast. He is game.Some fans have even started a petitionexternal-link for Donna to make the coin toss on Sunday, with 185,000 signatures at last glance.And come full-time, Donna said she will only have the option of joining the winning son on the field as ""the losers are immediately sent to their hotel. It's like 'go to your room'.""She added: ""I know both of them want this win desperately for bragging rights over the Thanksgiving table.""There have been brothers in the Super Bowl before. John and Jim Harbaugh were rival head coaches at Super Bowl 47, while twins Devin and Jason McCourty were on the same team as the New England Patriots won Super Bowl 53, but brothers on rival teams is a first.""Let's just think how incredibly rare it is just to make it to the NFL [from high school],"" said Jason Kelce. ""What are the chances that two guys get to the NFL [are signed], they realise their dream of playing in the NFL, then they become starters, All Pros and important pieces of their team, and then they end up playing each other in the Super Bowl?""Travis, who should have more of an impact on the game as he is one of the NFL's best receivers, added: ""It's wild - and kind of surreal. For it all to align like it has, it's mind-boggling.""It's a special moment. It's something we'll remember for the rest of our lives. You guys talking a lot about me and my brother has been fun, we appreciate it, but at the same time I'm just trying to get a win for the Chiefs."""

206,Wales face England test after Murrayfield mauling,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64613735,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Welsh RugbyHow times have changed. Less than four years ago, Warren Gatland managed a record 14 wins in a row as Wales head coach as he took the nation to the top of the world rankings ahead of the 2019 World Cup.Now Wales have lost 11 out of their last 14 games and are ranked ninth in the world. They are fortunate to be that high. It must be pointed out that Gatland has lost only two of those matches, with nine of the 12 defeats coming under his predecessor Wayne Pivac.But a record points defeat by Scotland, a week after a home hammering by Ireland, is not the start he craved having returned for a second spell as Wales coach.Losing to Gregor Townsend's side might have been expected. The manner of the Murrayfield mauling, with a scoreline which eclipsed a record defeat that had stood for 99 years, was perhaps not forecast by many.Captain Ken Owens admitted afterwards there would be a lot of external pressure heaped on the squad, while Gatland accepted his side are in a ""little bit of a hole"".The landscape of Welsh rugby since Gatland's last stint in charge has changed. Wherever you look there are problems.An independent task force tomorrow starts work to look into the culture of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) following the sexism scandal that rocked the game following a BBC Wales Investigates programme and prompted the resignation of former chief executive Steve Phillips.An extraordinary general meeting is scheduled for 26 March to try to push through major governance change.A long-term financial deal is yet to be officially signed between the WRU and regions with players out of contract at the end of the season still not being able to formally sign new deals.Gatland's return as coach has not inspired the immediate improvement in results WRU bosses had hoped it might. He needs time to turn things around.The senior men's results have often papered over the cracks of a failing Wales rugby system, which is bordering on not fit for purpose. Not any more. People who warned that those senior men's successes were masking issues elsewhere have been proved right.The stark statistics bring back memories of life before Gatland and darker times.  The New Zealander's first defeat to Scotland in 12 encounters as Welsh coach means Wales have lost their opening two Six Nations games for the first time since 2007, when Gareth Jenkins was in charge.Gatland has spoken about finding ""quick fixes"" to things like discipline and creativity as most areas of the Welsh game has proved substandard over the last two matches. There are also systemic, long-term issues ahead of the World Cup in France later this year. Gatland can only concern himself with matters on the field. That will certainly keep him occupied.Wales have had enough possession and territory in both Six Nations matches so far to prosper, yet what they have produced has been negligible.It is a common theme and one not just associated with this regime, as the previous attacking coaching staff struggled towards the end of the tenure to implement a game-plan which unlocked defences and capitalised on chances created.Former attack coach Stephen Jones was ditched by Gatland and replaced by Alex King, though only after a move for the return of Rob Howley was blocked by WRU bosses.King will need time to develop his offensive strategy but it has proved an inauspicious start, with the attacking game looking one-dimensional, clunky and lacking end product.On Saturday, Wales spent more than six minutes inside the Scotland 22 and scored only one try through a driving line-out, which tells its own damning story. The backline lacked any creativity or invention.Former Wales centre Jamie Roberts has suggested this Wales side lack an identity, a clear way of playing.Compare the insipid Welsh attack with the incisive offensive play produced by Scotland, who demonstrated the clinical and ruthless edge their opponents lacked.Scotland were orchestrated by Finn Russell, who outplayed British and Irish Lions team-mate Dan Biggar, unleashing the running abilities of Duhan van der Merwe, Kyle Steyn and Huw Jones. The contrast with what Wales produced in attack was like night and day.Gatland has appointed a former rugby league player from Wigan as his defence coach in his second stint in charge, just as he did in his first.This time, though, it is not Shaun Edwards but Mike Forshaw. Nine tries and 69 points conceded in the opening two matches is not the start he would have been looking for after coming in to replace Gethin Jenkins.Wales have not been helped by the dire discipline demonstrated in Cardiff and Edinburgh. Gatland admitted 19 penalties conceded against Scotland was unacceptable. Some of the offences were mindless, others came because of the pressure Wales were under, which highlighted other deficiencies within the Welsh game.There have not been many positive signs but the encouraging displays of Exeter duo Dafydd Jenkins and Christ Tshiunza in their first Wales starts might offer small crumbs of comfort.Gatland had made five personnel changes in the forwards after Ireland as he opted for youth ahead of experience.Jenkins, 20, and Tshiunza, 21, and Leicester flanker Tommy Reffell, 23, started with Alun Wyn Jones, 37, and Justin Tipuric, 33, left out of the squad and Taulupe Faletau, 32, dropped to the bench.The young trio all demonstrated some positive signs which indicated they are worth persevering with. Gatland rebuilt and rejuvenated sides during his first period in charge of Wales between 2008 and 2019. He has to do so once more.With the World Cup in mind, Gatland finds himself with a dilemma ahead of the home match against England and trips to face Italy and France.Does he keep faith with the players who suffered the infamy of a record defeat against Scotland, or turn back to the old guard who he left out at Murrayfield?England in Cardiff - which comes next for Wales, on 25 February - is not a fixture in which you would normally experiment, and Gatland knows the significance of the occasion. Wales are also aiming to avoid the wooden spoon and a first Six Nations whitewash since 2003.Gatland will face new England coach Steve Borthwick, another of his previous British and Irish Lions backroom staff members who are now Six Nations head coaches.Both Andy Farrell and Townsend have managed to comfortably get the better of their former boss.So this might prove Gatland's most testing time yet as he aims to recapture his golden touch.Nobody is expecting Gatland to return Wales to the top of the world rankings any time soon, if at all.But restoring some pride and respectability against Wales fiercest' rivals would be a welcome start.

207,Britain's Azim and Dubois win at Wembley Arena,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/64613781,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section BoxingBritain's Adam Azim remains unbeaten after earning a unanimous points decision against Nicaragua's Santos Reyes at Wembley Arena on Saturday.The Slough-born lightweight extended his record to eight wins but was taken to 10 rounds for the first time.He had won his last six bouts by knockout and had previously unbeaten Reyes, 25, on the canvas in the second round but was unable to put him away.London-born Caroline Dubois claimed her sixth pro win on the undercard.""I landed that right on the button,"" Azim, 20, told Sky Sports. ""I thought he was gone. ""I would rate my performance as probably an eight out of 10. He was very tough."" Reyes came into the bout on the back of 12 victories and showed his experience, getting back to his feet after a right-hand from Azim on the chin meant his legs buckled, but he held on to see out the second round.Azim remained dominant throughout, controlling the contest without being able to find the knockout blow, and was rewarded by all three judges who scored the fight 100-89 in his favour.Trainer Shane McGuigan said it was the fight they had wanted.""We got a knockdown, he got rounds, he got experience. He got a guy that had a tight guard and pushed him back,"" said McGuigan.""He learnt how to pace the rounds as well, so these are all the things we're doing in the gym but actually got to showcase on the live stage.""Dubois continued an impressive start to her professional career with a stoppage victory over Feriche Mashaury.The 22-year-old dominated from the off, dropping the Tanzanian early in the second round before the referee stepped in to end the bout 47 seconds into round three.It was Dubois' sixth win from six since turning professional last year, and fifth successive victory by stoppage.However, she said she was ""frustrated"" by how little resistance Mashaury, 25, showed during the bout.""It's not about going long but I wanted someone who would fight back, throw back,"" said Dubois.""She was negative from the first bell. She was literally turning away.""Elsewhere, American O'Shaquie Foster overcame Mexico's previously unbeaten two-division champion Rey Vargas with a unanimous points victory in San Antonio, Texas, to claim the vacant WBC super-featherweight title.It was the 29-year-old's first shot at a world title and took his record to 20 wins from 22 fights.""Man, it feels great,"" said Foster, whose career was slowed by a four-month spell in prison five years ago. ""This journey has been crazy.""Vargas, 32, was the WBC super-bantamweight champion from 2017 to 2019 and won the WBC featherweight title last July with a split decision over Filipino Mark Magsayo."

214,Motherwell sack Hammell after Raith defeat,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64613795,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section MotherwellMotherwell have sacked manager Steven Hammell after just six months in charge following his side's Scottish Cup defeat by Raith Rovers. The club have only won a single game since October - an away victory over Arbroath in the previous round.Motherwell's last home victory was in August, with just goal difference keeping them off the bottom of the Scottish Premiership.Stuart Kettlewell will take interim charge against St Mirren on Wednesday.""Steven Hammell is and will forever be a colossus,"" chairman Jim McMahon said.""Unfortunately, due to a number of factors, his time in charge hasn't worked out the way we all really hoped it would.""Although this decision has been difficult, we feel it is necessary as we look towards the last third of the Premiership season.""Hammell, the club's post-war appearance record holder, took over from Graham Alexander following Motherwell's collapse against Sligo Rovers in Europa Conference League qualifying.Despite a positive start, victories, particularly at Fir Park, proved difficult to come by as injuries and individual mistakes took their toll. The Lanarkshire side spurned a 2-0 lead against 10-man Kilmarnock in their first game back from the World Cup break to draw 2-2, and have lost to fellow strugglers Ross County, St Johnstone and managerless Aberdeen in recent weeks.Hammell, who will depart along with assistant Brian Kerr, was heavily backed in the January transfer, bringing in nine players to try to preserve their top-flight status.BBC Scotland football pundit Steven Thompson: ""He won't have enjoyed the last couple of months, given what the club means to him. ""There was an inevitability of what has happened. He'll have been well aware that the results weren't good enough. You kept waiting for it to turn for Motherwell but it never did and at some point something has to give because of the financial implications of relegation. It's too big a risk.""It's really disappointing for Stevie and a really tough introduction to management for him. Hopefully he won't be out the game too long.""For Motherwell it is two managers sacked in seven months. It is a club desperately in need of stability. I'm sure Stuart will do a good job in the interim but they need to get the new manager in place and it needs to be the right manager. The season is going to be over before you know it. The players need a massive lift in confidence."""
215,England power to emphatic World Cup win over Windies,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64611326,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section CricketEngland demonstrated their new aggressive style in superb fashion as they powered to a seven-wicket win over West Indies in their opening game at the Women's T20 World Cup in South Africa. Pre-match conversations have been dominated by the new approach and England raced to their target of 136 in 14.3 overs in a devastating show of power, innovation and skill in the scorching heat of Paarl. Opener Sophia Dunkley epitomised the approach with a blistering 34 off 17 balls, while Alice Capsey hit three boundaries in her 13. Nat Sciver-Brunt finished 40 not out and captain Heather Knight 32 as the pair made an unbroken 67 to guide England home with 33 balls to spare. West Indies made 135-7 from their 20 overs with opener and captain Hayley Matthews making an impressive 42 off 32 balls, while Shemaine Campbelle also added 34.World number one bowler Sophie Ecclestone claimed 3-23, while Katherine Sciver-Brunt and Sarah Glenn both claimed one each, alongside two run-outs in a solid fielding performance by England.England face Ireland in their next game on Monday (13:00 GMT), while West Indies play India on Wednesday. The win, and the manner in which it was achieved, was devastating and sets the perfect tone for England, who lost their opening game against South Africa in the 2020 edition.There were few faults in the field, with the bowlers targeting the stumps throughout, and they were backed up by a near faultless fielding performance.There were 12 wides, with Lauren Bell, playing in her first World Cup match, culpable for five as she struggled initially with the wind and that is an area England will look to improve.Ecclestone underlined her status as the best in the world by removing Matthews, who had attacked England in the powerplay and played really nicely through the off side, before returning to take two more wickets in the penultimate over. England took four wickets for 38 runs in the final five overs and that allowed them to restrict West Indies to a total that was eventually well below what was required.Dunkley was aggressive from the off and struck a beautiful six and then two fours off Matthews, before she was dismissed by a superb return catch by Chinelle Henry. However England's mantra was evident in every batter as someone else took on the mantle every time a wicket fell and their 58-2 off the six-over powerplay was their highest in a World Cup.Nat Sciver-Brunt demonstrated her usual power with the leg-side profitable, while Knight sealed the win with a six over cover, with the pair alleviating any potential nerves when England fell to 71-3.England's final run-rate of over 9.5 was a record for a side chasing more than 100 in the eight editions of the tournament and gives them a very healthy net run-rate that could become important as the group stages progress. England captain Heather Knight: ""They put us under massive pressure and we responded really well. It wasn't our best fielding and bowling performance. The attitude with the bat was exactly what we want to do.""We want to take the game on and entertain as well. We have set up our order to go hard at the top and we have depth to adapt if we need to. We made a good statement today.""West Indies captain Hayley Matthews: ""We spoke about getting above 145 or 150. We had a decent start weren't able to capitalise on the end but it was still a fighting total.""Every match is very important but the next one is crucial after today. We will take the positives and look at what we can do a bit better.""Player of the match Nat Sciver-Brunt talking to BBC Test Match Special: ""That is the way we've been playing and there is no reason we should change it now. We're really happy to get over the line with a good few balls to spare and that is testament to the way we want to play.""I felt frustrated in the field that we weren't getting wickets or playing as we had been so far but we didn't lose focus and then we were able to focus on getting those wickets. ""We have fielded a lot better than that since we've been here. That is definitely something we'll be looking to improve ahead of the next game."""

But he remained part of the board as club president until his death.The club have been known as Worcester Warriors since being rebranded and breaking away from the original Worcester Rugby Football Club by Duckworth in the late 1990s.Plans to align with fourth-tier Stourbridge and change their name from Worcester Warriors to Sixways Rugby need to be sanctioned by the RFU.Rival Worcester bidder Steve Diamond says the club would have played in the Championship this September, and would still be playing under their existing name, if their offer had been accepted.""It looks like they're clutching at straws,"" Diamond told BBC Hereford & Worcester.""There's an old saying that, in desperate times, people do desperate things.""What would I have done? I'd be playing in the Championship in September.""It has been reported that the new owners O'Toole and Sandford did not pass a 'fit and proper persons test' when the club's bid to be allowed to start next season in the Championship was rejected by the RFU on 16 December.They had already been chosen as preferred bidders in October by administrators Begbies Traynor following Warriors' early season financial collapse under previous owners Colin Goldring and Jason Whittingham.But Diamond says his consortium, allied with Warriors club sponsor Adam Hewitt, did actually have RFU approval.   ""We agreed with everything the RFU put in front of us, including paying the rugby creditors,"" he said.""I feel like the administrator has a statutory duty to the creditors. There are players, sponsors, supporters, staff, who are all owed a hell of a lot of money and none of them will receive any of that because of this.""If you pass the fit and proper person's test, part of that is agreeing to pay the unlimited amount of rugby creditors, which our consortium agreed to pay.""The complication comes about from the way Warriors were structured under the previous owners.WRFC Trading Ltd, the part of Whittingham and Goldring's operation which owned the ground at Sixways, went into administration on 26 September.WRFC Players Ltd, through which the Warriors players and staff were paid, was then wound up in the High Court in London on 5 October, causing the cancellation of contracts.""The rugby creditors are not looked upon by the administrators as secure creditors, so there's a loophole,"" added Diamond.Diamond was also critical of the proposed name change to Sixways Rugby.""People are proud of the name of their city,"" said Diamond. ""Sixways is an infrastructure on the M5.""It's great to have a plan, but this plan has never previously been identified or discussed.""The people who take over the legacy of Mr Duckworth have to have a plan for Worcester Warriors.""The DCMS [the Department for Culture and Media and Sport select committee] have demanded a parliamentary hearing and the governing body have been hauled over the coals.""The plan had to stand up to rigorous questioning - and that appears not to have happened. That's why this tangent has been taken, to go down three divisions to try and amalgamate with another first team at another club.""The plan to ditch the Worcester Warriors name was announced by co-owner O'Toole in an exclusive interview to BBC Hereford & Worcester on Thursday.The decision was made in an attempt to counter what the new prospective owners deemed to be the ""negativity"" associated with the existing brand - but it immediately led to a local outcry.Fans made their feelings clear to the BBC both on social media and on air but O'Toole's co-owner, fellow Irishman Sandford, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live on Friday, said that decision is not irreversible.""There are parts within our control,"" he said. ""One element of that is the brand. ""If we've got that wrong, I think we can hold our hands up and be honest and say 'it was a step too far'.""We're looking at everything and listening to everything. We've listened to the fans and community and we can look to re-engage.""We will stand up and be accountable for our mistakes and if that is one of them we can look at that, absolutely.""From our perspective, the club itself is the people around it, the community, the fans who are involved. We have come in to clean up a situation that has been created, make no qualms about it, by the previous owners under the RFU's watch.""Sandford also insists that the Atlas Group were also committed to paying off Warriors' rugby creditors.""We have never said that we would not pay rugby creditors, even with the new approach,"" he told BBC 5 Live. ""That's something that's been picked up and run with that's not entirely true.""Let's be transparent that in December, we had focused primarily on entering the Championship under Worcester Warriors.""It was made very clear to us we were to sign the insolvency terms as they stood, or there was no point in engaging any further.""Part of our bid was to pay off the rugby creditors and we had what to our side was an insurmountable sum of a range of ¬£2m and ¬£8m.""But we had terms put upon us by the RFU to pay that within 30 days without having the opportunity to do any due diligence on those, or understand who was the most critical of those rugby creditors.""We agreed that we wouldn't pay them in full but that we needed some time.""It is a difficult and trying time. We knew we were coming into a situation which was going to be challenging but we need to turn this round not for a quick solution. We need to make it sustainable."""

226,"Race, rap and the Arizona Super Bowl that never was",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/american-football/64561588,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section American FootballArizona is now an established Super Bowl host. But it hasn't always been like that.On Sunday, state capital Phoenix will host the NFL's championship game as the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles. It will be the fourth time the season showpiece has come to the city.But in the 1990s Arizona, tucked in the south-west of the United States, was an American football outpost.So what better way to put the state on the map than staging one of the world's biggest sporting and cultural events?""I feel as though I've won the lottery,"" said Governor Rose Mofford in March 1990 as Arizona earned the right to host the 1993 Super Bowl.""This is one Super Bowl that nobody will ever forget.""However, the NFL had underestimated something. Within the state, a debate was brewing to the boil.Politicians and celebrities had picked sides. Hip-hop superstars Public Enemy would release a song about it. And finally it engulfed the biggest sports event in the state's history - the 'Super Bowl that nobody would forget' instead became the Super Bowl that never happened.Arizona had only one professional sports team until the Cardinals NFL franchise, owned by the Bidwill family since 1933, moved from St Louis to Phoenix in 1988.Initially they played at a 70,000-capacity college stadium, which was only supposed to be a temporary home. It was hoped their support would grow to fill it. The opposite happened.In the Cardinals' first season in Arizona, they attracted an average crowd of 59,000. In the second, it dropped to 43,000 as a losing record got worse.Until then, the Super Bowl had most often been staged in Los Angeles, Miami or New Orleans, but the NFL had begun to expand its brand by taking its showcase event to other cities.So to help Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill boost his flagging franchise, the NFL handed Phoenix the 1993 Super Bowl.""The Super Bowl's a big deal, it's a monumental cultural event,"" Dr Todd Boyd, professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Southern California, told BBC Sport.""A lot of people host parties around it, everybody's watching - certainly back then as people didn't have as many things to watch.""American football is the most popular sport in the country and the Super Bowl's an unofficial national holiday.""In Arizona, though, it was in conflict with another national holiday.In 1983, President Reagan had signed into law a national holiday honouring Martin Luther King Jr, the pioneering black civil rights leader shot dead in 1968, on the third Monday of January.It took several years before those in Arizona could enjoy it. The Republican state legislature blocked several attempts to make it a paid state holiday.It was only in 1986 that Governor Bruce Babbitt - a Democrat - forced Martin Luther King Jr Day on to Arizona calendars by executive order.Babbitt made the announcement from the pulpit at the First Institutional Baptist Church in Phoenix, where Dr Warren Stewart is the senior pastor.""In his speech here, he said 'you're going to have to fight for it', which was really prophetic,"" Dr Stewart told BBC Sport.While running for election as Babbitt's successor, Evan Mecham made a campaign promise to rescind Babbitt's order. Days after taking office in 1987, he kept it.""King doesn't deserve a holiday,"" said Mecham. ""You folks don't need another holiday. What you folks need are jobs.""Supporters of the outspoken Republican insist he believed that economics was the key to improving the lives of black people in his state, but his comments on social issues made him a polarising figure.Dr Stewart knew where he stood.The pastor, who moved to Arizona from Kansas in 1977 via New York, formed a multi-faith, multi-race coalition to try to get Mecham or the state to pass a holiday.""We were angry, he disrespected the legacy of Martin Luther King,"" said Dr Stewart.Dr Boyd added: ""It's one thing to oppose it; it's another to repeal it once it's already been put in place.""There was no shame in Evan Mecham's game. He was comfortable openly flaunting his ignorance and bigotry.""In a lot of ways he sounded like a holdover from the type of characters you would have encountered in the 1960s - unapologetically bigoted, especially racist, and kind of a relic.""Mecham was removed from office in 1988 after being convicted in an impeachment trial of obstruction of justice and misuse of government funds.But his abrupt departure from power did not ensure the immediate return of the Martin Luther King holiday.Governor Mofford - Mecham's successor - supported its reinstatement. The Republican state legislature still opposed it. Deadlock.In November 1990, Dr Stewart's coalition collected enough signatures to force a tiebreaker - a vote by the people of Arizona themselves.With Phoenix having now been awarded the Super Bowl, they went to the polls knowing the NFL was watching.At the time, the percentage of black people in Arizona was about 4%, way below the US national percentage of 12%.Dr Stewart says he was not totally in favour of a people's vote ""because so many people didn't understand the holiday"". He would have preferred the state legislature to act.""That's their job,"" he said. ""When we started the coalition, I sent letters to all the white business leaders, the executives, to help us fight this and they ignored them. They wouldn't pay attention to us.""But when the NFL started suggesting they wouldn't bring the Super Bowl here, that's when the business community began to call me, to lead the fight towards the 1990 referendum.""I kind of backed away because I knew they didn't want it for the right reason. They just wanted a football game. I didn't feel comfortable working with them.""NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the league was ""trying to act in a fair-minded and responsible way"", that they didn't want to do ""anything punitive"".But as the people of Arizona took to the polls, the consequences were clear: a no vote would mean no Super Bowl.There was also some confusion as the ballot paper featured two propositions regarding a Martin Luther King holiday, which diluted the yes vote.Nevertheless, 51% voted against it.""All heck broke loose, the bad publicity,"" said Dr Stewart. ""We became the only state in the nation to vote on the holiday and we defeated two different versions.""It was terrible. The defeat caused the business leaders, the state, to be in a deep funk. It was like 'how could that happen?'""Five months later, in March 1991, the inevitable happened. The NFL confirmed it was moving Super Bowl 27 to Los Angeles.Arizona began to suffer the consequences. Hosting the Super Bowl would have brought more than $200m into the state.Stevie Wonder, who promoted the campaign for a national holiday to recognise Martin Luther King's birthday by releasing Happy Birthday in 1981, led a boycott of music events and conventions in Arizona, piling on the financial pain of the state's decision.There was the reputational hit too. Public Enemy summed up the mood of outsiders when they released their fourth studio album in 1991, which featured By The Time I Get To Arizona.Chuck D sings that ""the whole state's racist"" and although the song was not released as a single, it was still accompanied by a video.It depicted black paramilitaries assassinating white male politicians after one insisted he would ""stay opposed to the holiday as long as I am in office"".""Stevie Wonder and Public Enemy used their music to advocate for a political position,"" said Dr Boyd.""Public Enemy were very popular at the time, also controversial, and the interest they were attracting added to fully exposing Arizona for what was going on there. I think it got people talking about the issue who maybe otherwise wouldn't have been paying attention.""Dr Stewart was persuaded to launch a renewed effort with far stronger, more diverse coalition.Another state-wide vote on incorporating Martin Luther King Jr Day was held in November 1992 and this time it was passed with 62%.Dr Stewart said: ""The problem we had in Arizona was that the majority white people saw the King holiday as a black holiday, and since there were so few blacks here, they said: 'Well, why do we want it then?'""We had to run a state-wide campaign. Over six years of the coalitions, we had to educate them that the King holiday is an American holiday.""It's about a man who tried to help America be better, who in the 20th century helped to shape this nation like Abraham Lincoln did in the 19th century and George Washington did in the 18th. Then they got it, and I think the majority of the people voted for the right reason.""When the NFL met in March 1993 to decide the host city of the 1996 Super Bowl, they opted once again for Phoenix.This time there was no hitch. Ninety-four million US viewers watched the Dallas Cowboys beat the Pittsburgh Steelers to win Super Bowl 30 at a sold-out Sun Devil Stadium.On the back of that, the Phoenix convention centre was expanded, Arizona got professional baseball and ice hockey teams, and in 2006 the Cardinals finally got their own stadium, which hosted the Super Bowl in 2008 and 2015.In a 1988 track celebrating black excellence, Public Enemy referenced Doug Williamsexternal-link becoming the first black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl earlier that year.This year, as the big game returns to the state that refused to acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr Day, it will be the first Super Bowl in which the two starting quarterbacks are black.Many of the fan and media events are being held at an impressive convention centre in downtown Phoenix, less than a mile from the First Institutional Baptist Church where Dr Stewart preaches.Today, the neighbourhood around is adorned with murals that celebrate black icons and state that Black History Matters.And since last year, the street outside his church bears Stewart's name, meaning the pastor and his idol King are two of the few people to have a street named after them in Phoenix.As the city celebrated this year's Martin Luther King Jr Day, basketball player Brittney Griner, who plays for Phoenix Mercury, surprised fans by joining a march just weeks after she was released from a Russian penal colony.Looking back, Dr Stewart and Dr Boyd agree that the NFL's decision to strip Arizona of the Super Bowl contributed to progress.""The legislators and a lot of the people wouldn't listen to reason,"" said Dr Stewart. ""All we wanted to do was join the rest of the nation. But I'm proud we went from being a national embarrassment to a national example.""Dr Boyd added that the NFL had been ""forward-thinking and proactive"" and feels the statement they made is still very relevant today.""The NFL has never been perceived to be this left-wing politically progressive organisation, but whatever the reasons, they recognised there was no up-side for them with keeping the Super Bowl in Arizona,"" he said. ""They didn't want to be tainted with that stain.""The NFL was smart, in the same way Reagan was. You don't want to be the sports league that supported a state that opposed the King holiday. That's not going to age well.""The NFL is not a social justice organisation, it's an entertainment entity interested in making a profit. But they sent a message in terms of doing business.""It said that 'if you want to be kind of off by yourself [in your beliefs] then fine, but you're not going to have a Super Bowl'.""In spite of what the governor and others might have believed, there's a point where you become a pariah. People recognised there's certain lines you can't cross."""

He started on the 10th and mixed four bogeys with two birdies in blustery conditions.He did, however, make an incredible par on the second hole after a wayward drive left his ball a foot from a fence. With trees blocking his view of the green, he gouged out a sensational shot from 128 yards and two-putted from 42 feet.The Phoenix Open is one of the PGA Tour's new 'elevated' events with a prize fund of $20m (¬£16.5m), which is more than double last year's offering. The winner will take home $3.6m, up from $1.5m last year.Australia's former world number one Jason Day leads on six under, one ahead of Canadians Nick Taylor and Adam Hadwin with American Xander Schauffele a stroke further back.Both Jon Rahm and Scottie Scheffler have a chance of taking the world number spot off McIlroy this weekend.World number three Rahm of Spain completed his first round on three under, along with world number two Scheffler.England's US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, who started on the 10th hole, had three successive birdies from the third hole (his 12th) as he carded a one-under 70, the same score as compatriots Aaron Rai and Tyrrell Hatton."

We have already been condemned.""You have to understand that 19 teams in the Premier League are accusing us without us having the ability to defend.""We are lucky we live in a marvellous country where everyone is innocent until proven guilty.""We didn't have this opportunity, we are already sentenced. I am fully convinced we will be [proven] innocent.""The Premier League has referred City to an independent commission over alleged rule breaches between 2009 and 2018, during which time the club won three of their six Premier League titles.It also accused City of not co-operating since the investigation started in December 2018.The commission can impose punishments ranging from a fine and points deduction to expulsion from the Premier League.City, who were bought by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008, said they were ""surprised"" by the charges and their innocence is supported by a ""body of irrefutable evidence"".Guardiola reiterated that confidence in a defiant news conference on Friday, during which he also said he believes the charges have been driven by rival clubs.When asked if he believed that was the case, he said: ""Of course - it is the Premier League. I don't know why. You have to ask the CEOs.""They have opened a precedent right now, what they have done to us.""Be careful, be careful in the future, as there's a lot of clubs that have been accused like we have without being innocent, who knows what will happen in the future?""They believe that we didn't behave properly, we can accept that, but let us defend when we believe we did it properly.""Guardiola previously said he would leave City if allegations they broke financial rules were proven.However, he said he had no intention of quitting on Friday, adding: ""I am not moving from this seat, I can assure you.

229,F1 track invaders guilty of causing public nuisance,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-64601297,"A group of Just Stop Oil protesters have been found guilty of risking ""serious harm"" during a track invasion at the Formula 1 British Grand Prix.Four men and two women were convicted of causing a public nuisance.The jury was shown footage of five of them sitting on Silverstone's Wellington Straight as two F1 cars passed close by.Prosecutors said the group had caused an immediate risk of serious harm. They will be sentenced next month.Northampton Crown Court heard the group had sat ""in the face"" of fast-moving vehicles and risked serious harm to F1 drivers and race marshals at the track in Northamptonshire.The six protesters convicted of causing a public nuisance were:Footage was shown at the trial of F1 drivers Yuki Tsunoda and Esteban Ocon passing three men and two women who were sitting on, or being dragged off, the track on 3 July.The protesters claimed the demonstration had a ""meticulous"" safety plan and did not pose a risk of serious harm.Brocklebank, Gibson, Mogie, McKechnie and Smith invaded the track and Baldwin was found in a car park with glue, cable ties and a Just Stop Oil banner.Prosecutors said the group were all ""in it together"".Simon Jones, counsel for the prosecution, said the action took place as the race was under a red flag due to a serious accident at the start.""The prosecution say that there was clearly an immediate risk of serious harm being caused,"" he said.""Plainly they could have been struck by fast-moving vehicles with obvious severe consequences.""We say that that their actions also caused risk to the drivers themselves and the marshals.""McKechnie, who grew up in Weymouth in Dorset, told jurors the group had planned the protest over two and a half months, making it as safe as possible.The six were all told they faced a possible jail term when they returned to court on 31 March.Mr Justice Garnham told the activists' barristers: ""All of them should understand and be in no doubt that I will be considering all possible options when it comes to sentence, and that includes the possibility of a prison sentence.""All six were granted bail after providing a verbal commitment not to become involved in further protests while awaiting sentence.

230,IABA withdraw Irish boxers from 2023 Worlds,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/64601399,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section BoxingIreland will boycott this year's men's and women's World Boxing Championships after the Irish Athletic Boxing Association (IABA) voted not to send fighters to either tournament. The IABA's move is in protest over the way the sport is governed by the International Boxing Association (IBA). The decision was taken at a meeting of the IABA's Board of Directors and Central Council in Dublin on Thursday.In reponse the IBA said it would pursue strong sanctions IABA referees and judges will also not officiate at either tournament.New Delhi in India is set to stage the women's event next month while the men's tournament is scheduled to be held in the Uzbekistan capital Tashkent in May.The decision means current world champions Amy Broadhurst and Lisa O'Rourke will not be able to defend their titles in India next month and Olympic champion Kellie Harrington, who missed last year's championships because of injury, will miss out on the chance to win a second world gold. ""The IABA urges the IBA to engage in governance reform and implement the recommendations of its own experts on fiscal responsibility, fair play, and inclusion,"" read an IABA statement. ""IBA practices and activities are not of the standard required to secure our sport's future. There are no winners in the current landscape. ""All members deserve a level playing field in tournaments run to the highest possible standard by an organisation which has their welfare, their futures, and their sport at its heart.""Gold medallists at the men's championships will receive $200,000 (¬£165,000) for winning although the women's gold medallists will only receive half that figure.Ireland join the USA who this week announced they were boycotting the championships.Both countries are closely aligned with the Common Cause Alliance (CCA), a group of nations whose focus is for boxing to remain at the Olympics, and it is expected that many more European countries will not be sending teams either.The IBA has been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) since 2019 over governance issues and alleged corruption.Boxing at the Tokyo Olympics was organised by the IOC and will be again for Paris 2024, but beyond that the sport has been left off the initial programme for Los Angeles 2028 as the IBA has refused to implement changes the IOC wants.Under their Russian President Umar Kremlev, the IBA has also reinstated Russian and Belarusian boxers to international competition, allowing them to compete under their national flags and using their anthems despite the ongoing war in Ukraine. Irish boxers will now focus on preparing for the European Games in Poland, where the majority of places for the Paris Olympics will be won, which will be held from 21 June until 2 July.The IABA added: ""The IABA and its athletes are focused on preparations for the European Games in June, and winning qualification to Paris 2024. ""That preparation will include training camps, sparring camps and tournaments with sister federations. The IABA will continue to create opportunities for training, development, and competition for its boxers, nationally and internationally, across all age groups.""The IBA have described the statements from the IABA and USA Boxing as ""truly regretful, as they unreasonably damage the reputation of their international governing body as it directly contravenes many articles of the IBA Disciplinary and Ethics Code, and above all, it damages the reputation of IBA, as it is based on defamatory half truths, which is unacceptable"". It added: ""While the IBA has been making great strides in implementing reforms and cultivating a new culture within the sport. This attack on IBA cannot be seen as anything other than a clear act to damage IBA's reputation and breach the values IBA professes while failing to acknowledge the tremendous work done by IBA and supporting the governing body in its efforts and best intentions.   ""IBA will support any athlete that wants to participate in the World Championships, to allow them to fulfil their dream of becoming a World Champion. We will protect our athletes, coaches, and the IBA Constitution.""The IBA said the statements of ""USA Boxing Executive Director/CEO Mr. Mike McAtee and the leadership of the Irish Athletics Boxing Association"" will be investigated to see if there has been a breach of articles of the IBA Disciplinary and Ethics Code.It listed five possible breaches ""amongst others"" - disparagement of IBA's reputation and interests, inciting a boycott of a competition, refusal or late participation in competition, neutrality and loyalty and finally discrimination and defamation outside competition.""The athletes, coaches and officials from a country shall not be liable for any conduct of the management of their national federations or any political games. IBA condemns all political games which damages the sport,"" the IBA added.""IBA will strongly react on further similar conduct in breach of the IBA Disciplinary and Ethics Code, and will pursue strong sanctions against those who initiate and join the participation boycott."""

For now a new contract is secondary, the most important thing is the team and the games. We'll see where we are in May.""There's nothing I can say about what's going to happen in the summer. I don't even know what's going to happen on Saturday.""Raya, whose current deal with the Bees expires in June 2024, has made 144 appearances for the club since joining from Blackburn Rovers in 2019. However, his stance has left Brentford boss Thomas Frank convinced that he may be about to lose a player who has been an ever present for him in the Premier League this term. ""If he turns [a contract] down twice then, unfortunately, that is a signal,"" Frank said.""That being said, David has been amazing. He is one of the best keepers in the league. He is one of the captains and leads with his performances and behaviour every day.""Raya has kept eight clean sheets for Brentford in the top flight this season, with the club seventh in the table, six points behind fifth-placed Tottenham in the Europa League spot with a game in hand.His impressive displays also saw him gain his first international caps during 2022 and a place in Spain's World Cup squad.Brentford take on league leaders Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on Saturday."
232,Murray to face France after father injured in crash,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64576158,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Irish RugbyIreland scrum-half Conor Murray is in ""good form"" and is set to play against France in the Six Nations despite his father sustaining ""serious injuries"" in a road traffic collision.Murray's dad Gerry is being treated in hospital after colliding with a truck while cycling in County Limerick.""He's in good form, he's back with the group and looking forward to the game,"" said Irish scrum coach John Fogarty.""We wish his dad the very best from the squad and a quick recovery."" Asked if there was a possibility of the Munster back being stood down for the match, Fogarty replied: ""Not that I'm aware of. Conor's good, he's great, all considered.""According to police, the 33-year-old's father was cycling on the N20 near Patrickswell on Tuesday afternoon when he was injured.The Munster back, though, was named in Ireland's starting XV for Saturday's match at Aviva Stadium.Head coach Andy Farrell opted against going into specific details about the player's personal issue on Thursday before news broke of the incident.Murray, who has 101 Ireland caps, started last weekend's 34-10 win in Wales after stepping in as a late replacement due to a hamstring injury to first-choice number nine Jamison Gibson-Park.The mouthwatering meeting of the world's top two nations is being touted as a probable championship title decider.Last year's encounter lived up to that billing, with Ireland having to settle for the consolation of a Triple Crown after France went on to complete the Grand Slam following a 30-24 round-two success in Paris."

235,Will England centre pair suit Farrell at fly-half?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64603036,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Rugby Unioncomments447England head coach Steve Borthwick is relying on a new-look centre pairing to help Owen Farrell unlock Italy's defence in the Six Nations on Sunday.Ollie Lawrence starts at 12 while Henry Slade returns from a hip injury to replace Joe Marchant, who drops out of the squad, at outside centre.Farrell retains his starting role by moving from inside centre to replace Marcus Smith at fly-half.Borthwick says his available options in midfield helped make his decision.""Having Slade available this week has been very important,"" Borthwick said at Friday's news conference.""He wasn't available last week and having his distribution skills and his left foot kicking option is also a great strength. Any team that has the ability to have right and left-footed kickers in the backline has a strength.""Borthwick, who was England's forwards coach between 2015 and 2020, added: ""I look back at some of the games in the first period I was with the England team as an assistant coach and the way Henry played in some very important games for us.  ""I have been out of the team for two or three years but coming back, I can't tell you how impressed I have been with him and the determination he has had to be in this team.""He is clearly more experienced now and is a seasoned campaigner at club and international level and he has an outstanding skillset.""Farrell, Lawrence and Slade all start together for the second time, the only other occasion a defeat against Scotland in the 2021 Six Nations.Lawrence, who will make his fourth England start, is rewarded for his club form for Bath, where his physicality in attack and defence has not gone unnoticed. England struggled to break the gainline in their opening defeat by Scotland with Farrell at 12 and Marchant utilised as a first phase ball-carrying option.Smith has struggled to recreate his club form with Harlequins at Test level and Borthwick will be hoping Farrell's move to his more comfortable position at fly-half and Lawrence's inclusion can give his side the edge in midfield.He added: ""Ollie Lawrence brings a certain skillset which he has been showing tremendously in the Premiership this season in the way he carries the ball and the way he also defends in the physical manner he does.""These comments are now closed."

Both Scheffler and Rahm, 28, have the chance to move above Northern Ireland's McIlroy to top the world rankings with victory in this tournament.Scheffler followed up his maiden win on the PGA Tour in last year's Phoenix Open with victory in the 2022 Masters, while Rahm has started the year in fine form following consecutive victories in the Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express.McIlroy, meanwhile, has recovered from an opening-day 73 to move back into contention. The 33-year-old is aiming for a third consecutive victory on the PGA Tour following wins in the Tour Championship in August and the CJ Cup in October. He also won two weeks ago in Dubai on the DP World Tour in his first tournament of the year. "
237,Gatland admits Wales are in a 'bit of a hole',https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64562093,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Welsh RugbyWales coach Warren Gatland admits his side are in a ""bit of a hole"" after suffering a record points defeat against Scotland.The 35-7 loss was a second successive defeat for Gatland after taking over as head coach for a second time.It was also an 11th loss in 14 matches for Wales, with England visiting Cardiff on 25 February.""We are in a little bit of a hole at the moment and it's how we fight our way out of it,"" said Gatland.Wales' previous record points defeat against Scotland was a 35-10 loss in Edinburgh in 1924.This was Gatland's first loss against Scotland as Wales head coach in 12 attempts - and also the first time the side have lost their opening two Six Nations matches since 2007.""It's about being tight as a group and honest and critical of the things we know we can fix up,"" he added.""We just have to do it pretty quickly.""When asked whether Wales are suffering from a lack of confidence, Gatland said: ""Yes, possibly. Sometimes, winning becomes a habit, but so does losing as well. It's just about getting through that.""From our point of view you finish chances and you need to be vocal and communicating from the outside in.""There were some players who were quiet on a few occasions. That's probably down to a little bit of lack of confidence at certain stages.""The first couple of performances have been disappointing. We spoke in the changing room afterwards and it's about making sure that we are honest as a group.""Gatland admitted discipline and not being clinical were major contributory factors to yet another loss.""It was probably some of the same stuff against Ireland so we need to be pretty ruthless in terms of how we approach going forward,"" he added.""We have given away 19 penalties in the game which is not acceptable at this level.""Again we have created opportunities and not been clinical enough. We have been in the 22 for about six minutes and not come away with much.""The disappointing thing is when you've focused on a number of things during the week and they don't improve.""Gatland had made five personnel changes in the forwards following defeat by Ireland as he opted for youth instead of experience.Exeter pair Dafydd Jenkins, 20, and Christ Tshiunza, 21 and Leicester flanker Tommy Reffell, 23, started with Alun Wyn Jones, 37, and Justin Tipuric, 33, left out of the squad and Taulupe Faletau, 32, on the replacements bench.""I thought Dafydd Jenkins was good, Christ Tshiunza had some good carries so, for me, that was some of the positives the input of those guys and I was pleased with them,"" said Gatland.""People were calling for changes and then you make changes and they talk about the players who have been left out. Sometimes it's a lose-lose situation.""Gatland also said centre George North had passed his head injury assessment (HIA) after being the victim of a high tackle from Scotland hooker George Turner, who was shown a yellow card for the challenge.Wales insist they followed the HIA protocols and North was deemed fit to return for the second half.They have three matches left in the Six Nations with England at home followed by away trips to face Italy and France.Gloucester wing Louis Rees-Zammit will be fit to face England as Gatland weighs up to what to do with his side before the World Cup in France later this year.""I think that time together in terms of preparation for the World Cup will take care of a lot of that stuff, but we've got a more urgent issue at the moment in fixing things that are being costly for us,"" he explained.""I don't think they are hard fixes. I just think it's making sure we are mentally switched on and a bit more clinical from an attack perspective.""When we come under pressure we need to trust ourselves, trust each other, trust the system, and make sure we aren't giving away unforced penalties or doubling up on errors or piggy-backing up the field.""We were guilty of that last week and we were guilty of that today.""It is something, when I have been involved with Wales, we have prided ourselves on our discipline, trusting the systems and each other and being clinical when we create opportunities. ""It is something we need to fix pretty quickly."""
238,Borthwick targets first win of England reign,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64611800,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Rugby UnionFollowing their narrow defeat against Scotland last weekend, England's new head coach Steve Borthwick made a bold statement deep within the bowels of an empty Twickenham.The former Leicester boss said his team ""weren't good at anything"" under his predecessor Eddie Jones.Was it a ploy to emphasise the size of his task? Or perhaps a way to suggest improvements had already been made despite failing to win back the Calcutta Cup?Perhaps Borthwick was just being frank, but the man now in charge of England knows it is wins and not candid statements he needs.He goes looking for the first victory of his tenure against Italy at Twickenham and England's unbeaten history against the visitors suggests there is every chance it will arrive - but this young Azzurri side poses a different threat to that faced previously.The big question mark over selection was the fly-half position and Borthwick has opted for the tried-and-tested pragmatism of Owen Farrell over the dynamic flair of Marcus Smith.Farrell was perhaps unlikely to be dropped after Borthwick named him captain upon his arrival, and the Saracens man will be responsible for unleashing a new-look midfield.In Ollie Lawrence he has a physical ball carrier who will test the gainline at inside centre, while Henry Slade is an elegant runner and distributor at 13.England were true to their pre-game promise against Scotland as they looked to move the ball quickly in attack. But Joe Marchant, who drops out of the matchday squad entirely, failed to punch enough gaps in the blue line as a crash runner.Lawrence has an 11kg advantage over Marchant so Borthwick will hope for more impact. Once the line has been broken, Slade's skillset will come to the fore in attacking the space and feeding the back three.Yet perhaps the most exciting news from the team announcement surrounded a player who will start on the bench.London Irish wing Henry Arundell has recovered from a foot problem and has been named among the replacements, from where England attack coach Nick Evans says he will be ""deployed"".""Henry's special, so special, and I've loved watching him train,"" said the former New Zealand fly-half.""He reacts on instinct. When he gets the opportunity to come in, it's all about getting him into space and creating as many one-on-ones for him as possible. The one v one is something he works really hard on. It's a super strength of his.""Duhan van der Merwe spoiled Borthwick's welcoming party last weekend with two memorable tries.Italy may not have anyone with the same physical attributes in their armoury, but in Ange Capuozzo, they have one of Europe's deadliest finishers.The 23-year-old full-back has scored six tries in eight international appearances after arriving on the Test scene from relative obscurity in the penultimate weekend of last year's competition. Capuozzo's attacking endeavour typifies the young Azzurri side, which has an average age of 26.Victory against Wales on the final day of 2022 ended a 36-game losing run in the competition before Australia were beaten for the first time last autumn.They ran defending champions France close on the opening day before Matthieu Jalibert sniped over to claim victory with just minutes remaining.Italy have never beaten England but head coach Kieran Crowley will want his side to play with freedom and attempt to exploit a defence that leaked four tries last weekend. Speaking to BBC Sport, Italy's 21-year-old Welsh-born scrum-half Stephen Varney said: ""With Kieran coming in, he has brought a new playing style which suits the players we have.""It's been a really good year for us and hopefully we get a few wins now in the Six Nations.""We want to play from everywhere, as you saw against France. ""We got close against France and we are up for the challenge against England."""

The Scot navigated it superbly to seal victory by 31 points, further cementing her status as the most successful rider in the history of the championship.Wood, 27, will also be delighted by his maiden gold at this level having won eight European bronze medals prior to this year.Meanwhile, Bigham, who briefly held the world hour record in 2022 qualified fastest in the men's individual pursuit, setting a new track record in Grenchen.However, he was unable to hold off the fast-finishing Italian Jonathan Milan, who came through to claim gold in the final kilometre. Capewell shrugged off a fall earlier on Friday evening as she beat world champion Mathilde Gros of France to celebrate her first individual medal at this level."

McClean has not played in recent weeks, with manager Rodney McAree, who took over from Mick McDermott last month, saying a few weeks ago that the defender had a heel problem but that it was not serious.""It's not been an easy decision but it's the one that I've been thinking about for a while now,"" McClean said in an Instagram post.""I've had a good journey and met some amazing people that will be friends for life and worked with some top players/coaches.""Thank you to everyone who's been a part of out, over and out."""
254,England face Ireland amid WPL auction excitement,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64617536,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section CricketIt is not often a World Cup fixture feels like the underwhelming event of the day. But with the Women's Premier League auction taking place on the morning of England's encounter with Ireland in Paarl, it is no wonder all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt says it all feels ""a bit weird"". Players are expected to go for potentially life-changing sums of money in the competition, a women's edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's biggest franchise tournament. There has been debate, speculation and excitement around the auction and which players will be picked up by the five franchises - three of which are owned by IPL teams.""We don't want to avoid talking about it and be all secretive about it,"" said Sciver-Brunt, 30.""We've had a chat as a group about how individuals want to go about it."" England take on Ireland at 13:00 GMT, and the auction is expected to start at approximately 09:00 GMT, meaning some - but perhaps not all - of the players will know if they have been selected or not before the game begins. Captain Heather Knight admitted pre-tournament that it would naturally be ""a distraction"", and the timings mean there is some ambiguity around whether the players will know their fate before play. ""It's up to individuals how they want to go about it and prepare,"" said Sciver-Brunt, who is expected to be one of the most sought-after players. ""But when we get to the ground we will be fully focused on our match. It's an exciting time, but it is a weird one that it is happening on game day."" Another England player expected to be one of the first to be picked up is left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone, the world's best bowler in T20 cricket who took 3-23 in England's opening World Cup win against West Indies. But despite being one of the world's most high-profile players, Ecclestone remains calm about the prospect of the WPL - though acknowledges the excitement surrounding the build-up.""It's going to be a really interesting day,"" said Ecclestone. ""It will be weird having the auction in the morning but everyone is just focused on our game in the afternoon."" It is likely that all of India's players will be selected, and the vast majority of double world champions Australia's squad. For England, all players put their names in the auction but only the likes of Sciver-Brunt, Ecclestone and batter Danni Wyatt are almost guaranteed picks.But around all the excitement, the challenge for England and head coach Jon Lewis - who is also coaching a WPL franchise - will be to try and avoid the distraction, though Ecclestone is not expecting to know the outcome before the game.""I've not really thought about it much and it's just a match day for me, no matter what happens tomorrow,"" said Ecclestone. ""I don't think we'll know before, because we won't have our phones, but we'll just see what happens and go with the flow."""

257,Can we make the internet less power-thirsty?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64429819,"So much of what we do every day involves a data centre. Shopping online, streaming TV shows, reading this story - they all need data to be stored and readily available.The immediacy and convenience of those services is great, but that comes at a cost.Data centres need huge amounts of electricity to keep them going - a large facility will use as much electricity as a medium sized town.The situation is particularly acute in Ireland, where a relatively small electricity grid is hosting a ballooning number of data centres.More than 20 of these are in Dublin where Microsoft and Amazon have built very large sites.Altogether the nation hosts 75 data centres with 11 more under construction and, according to energy consultants Baringa, they could take up 27% of the national electricity output by 2029.That alarming demand for electricity has forced the Irish government to take action. Sustainability is now a pre-condition of approval for new data centres with the government stating that ""new-build data centres must be able to flexibly reduce power consumption"".Technology is being deployed in the hope of making data centres less of a burden on the power grid.A new facility, opened at Grange Castle on the outskirts of Dublin, has its connection to the electricity grid managed by software from the firm Eaton in conjunction with energy giant Enel.If the wider electricity grid is under stress, the electricity to the data centre is shut off and back-up systems immediately kick-in.All data centres operate sophisticated stand-by systems that keep them running in case of any electricity outage.The first line of this defence is Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) devices. These are effectively sophisticated batteries that cut right in the split second they're needed and run for enough time to allow a diesel generator to kick in or for mains power to be restored.At Grange Castle, Eaton's UPS intervenes and frees up power on the grid when the grid's electrical frequency, measured in hertz, fluctuates in a way that indicates it is under stress.This might be when power from unstable sources, such as Ireland's vast wind farms, dips.Many data centres already remove demand from the grid for a pre-defined period using established technology from companies such as Schneider Electric and Vertiv.But the Grange Castle arrangement is claimed to be the first time a live, dynamic relationship has been established between a data centre and a national grid. Ciaran Forde from Eaton is a physicist who specialises in data centres. He says Eaton's system acts like a pressure valve pulling the data centre off the grid for valuable interludes.The owners of the data centre get paid for this flexibility by the Irish grid operator.Jay Dietrich, from the Uptime Institute which certifies data centres for resilience and reliability, says that income is probably the primary reason that data centre owners are keen to be flexible.""They're not doing this for noble reasons. They are doing it for cash flow and revenue,"" says Mr Dietrich, whose career has involved working on energy policy and climate change at IBM.Ireland provides a snapshot of a global problem. In July 2022 London's governing body, the Greater London Authority, wrote to housing developers in the west of the capital warning they could face prolonged waits before new developments could be connected to the grid. Despite a housing shortage across London, new residential projects could face a delay of a decade because data centres in the Thames Valley were hoovering up electrical capacity leaving the gird unable to guarantee power for London's growing population. How did we get here? Eaton's Mr Forde says it is really down to the explosive growth of cloud computing - the trend which has seen companies outsource much of their data storage and processing to third-party firms like Amazon and Microsoft.He points out that using the term ""cloud"" is highly misleading, as it is ""a very physical thing"".The cloud does not float in the atmosphere, it consists of computer servers with a vast appetite for electricity. More technology of business:The Irish example highlights how a combination of environmental concerns and worries about capacity in the grid have triggered a race to save the reputation of the data centre industry.New technology fixes are being developed.At Brunello, a town near the Swiss border in Northern Italy, data management business Pure Storage is putting a data centre on a digital diet by trimming bits and bytes and junking surplus information.Storage devices at Brunello use software that spots when information is duplicated unnecessarily and deletes that material. This process of perpetual review and removal restrains ballooning volumes of data. It sounds like a mundane job for the IT department, but this program is tackling the data centre industry's biggest enemy head-on. It is reducing the horrific appetite for electric power that characterises all data centres. Pure claims it can slice as much as 80% off a data centre's power usage.Pure executive James Petter, who came to technology via the British Army and Coca-Cola, takes a blunt approach to the problem of power consumption and has no illusions about how important this is.""We design our equipment around the principle of lowering power use. And right now all the requests we get from prospective data centre customers are about power consumption.""They used to ask about technology and price first, but today carbon emissions and renewables are what count. It's all about carbon footprints, everyone's on the bandwagon.""  He says that this trend has taken off in the past two years as energy consumption rose to dominate ""the CEO agenda"". Speaking from Riyadh he describes how the last three data centre providers he spoke to in Saudi Arabia were all deeply concerned about their carbon footprint. Mr Petter is reluctant to concede that there might be a limit to how much data we can store. ""The macro trend is for data to increase. I do think innovation will continue, there will be new ways of storing the data."" It's not in the technology industry's commercial interest to impose limits on how many photos we all store in the cloud. But if data centres want to win planning permission and maintain public approval they will have to concentrate on imaginative moves that slash their enormous power consumption.  "

He is also England's joint top scorer with Rooney on 53.Speaking before Spurs' 4-1 defeat by Leicester, Shearer told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There is not one minute of any day I look back at my career and say I wish had gone to Manchester United because I would have won medals. ""Harry has the Tottenham record and will have a statue, will get the England record and probably a statue at Wembley and a good chance the Premier League record. They are his medals.""I can see why he would take the decision to stay at Tottenham. He already has greatness around him and if he doesn't win a trophy I don't think will bother him at all.""He is the only one who can answer it, if he can say 'I'm the happiest guy alive, I have all the records, I might not have a trophy, but I'm happy'.""Kane recently passed Jimmy Greaves' record of 266 Spurs goals that had stood since 1970. He is 60 goals behind Shearer's Premier League record.Former Arsenal and England defender Martin Keown agreed with Shearer that the records count as success.""If he's not winning trophies then it is a trophy on its own if he's going to score the most Premier League goals of all time,"" Keown said.""I do admire him staying at Spurs? I like the fact he's a one-club player. But it is a big dilemma for him, surely he wants to win some trophies?""He's top class, he will take that record and then we won't have to talk about Alan Shearer anymore. I think he'll make 300 goals, without doubt."""
261,VAR error in Brighton v Crystal Palace: Goal incorrectly ruled out for offside,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64613315,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Premier LeagueBrighton had a goal incorrectly ruled out for offside because of human error by the video assistant referee operator in their draw at Crystal Palace.Pervis Estupinan looked to have put the Seagulls in front in the first half.VAR John Brooks intervened and ruled that the Ecuador defender was offside when he received Pascal Gross' pass.However, the offside line was wrongly drawn from James Tomkins rather than his fellow Palace defender Marc Guehi, who was standing just behind him.If the line had been drawn from Guehi, Brighton's left-back would have been onside and the goal would have stood.At the end of last month, Roberto de Zerbi's side were denied a penalty against Leicester City for a foul on striker Danny Welbeck which former top-flight referee Dermot Gallagher said should have been given.The mistake at Selhurst Park was one of several incidents around VAR decisions in Saturday's Premier League matches. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta accused officials of ""changing the rules"" after claiming Brentford's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Emirates Stadium should have been ruled out for offside.Earlier in the day Chelsea were denied a late penalty against West Ham United despite Tomas Soucek appearing to block Conor Gallagher's shot with his arm.

""Sometimes they go for you and sometimes they don't, you just have to accept that.""Former England defender Danny Murphy said the decision was ""absolutely ludicrous"".""I am lost for words at the incompetence of the people doing VAR,"" he added.Soucek was falling to his left when he diverted the shot by substitute Gallagher off the target with his left hand.Despite a VAR check, no penalty was given and the match ended 1-1.""No wonder these Chelsea players are going bananas,"" former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand told BT Sport.""What a save - I cannot believe it has not been given. It's a stonewall penalty.""Chelsea legend and former West Ham boss Gianfranco Zola added: ""It is clearly the hand - it is not attached to the body. A shot at goal is blocked, in my opinion a penalty.""Former Premier League referee Peter Walton said he was disappointed the video assistant referee did not tell Pawson to watch the incident again on the pitch side monitor.""The law is clear,"" Walton told BT Sport.""VAR clearly thinks the arm was in a natural position to break its fall. When you look at it closely the ball is past his knee and he decides his arm is there. ""I am disappointed VAR didn't give the referee a chance to look at it.""Despite spending big over the past two transfer windows, Chelsea have won just one of their past seven Premier League games.They are marooned in mid-table and a challenge for a top-four finish looks increasingly unlikely.Former players are split on where the club is heading under Potter, who is five months into a five-year contract.Ex-Chelsea and West Ham keeper Rob Green told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It's if he finds his best XI - if he gets given the time - and I'm not sure he will.""Former England captain Alan Shearer, also speaking on 5 Live, added: ""Potter knows the rules in football.

265,Chelsea: Who is in their best XI? Plus pick your team,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64544614,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Premier League""The manager doesn't know his best team.""It is a regular criticism aimed at any head coach who frequently makes changes to a struggling side in search of a winning formula.It is one Chelsea boss Graham Potter, armed with a bulging roster of high-priced talent, is likely to hear a lot unless his side put together a winning run and move up the Premier League table.There were murmurs of it after the soulless 0-0 draw with Fulham on Friday that included five of Chelsea's new signings from the ¬£300m-plus January spending spree that was sanctioned by the club's new owners.That outlay followed almost the same amount spent in the summer, with a total of 17 new players brought to Stamford Bridge through two transfer windows.However, as the dust settled on their first league game since the transfer window closed, they had mustered a mere three shots on target and no goals.When asked about his player shopping, Potter said: ""It's a team for the now and for the future."" But, after such significant outlay, Potter has to hope Todd Boehly and the new ownership group are less trigger-happy than their notoriously impatient predecessor at Stamford Bridge.For many of the Premier League's best teams - Manchester United in 1999, Arsenal's Invincibles of 2004, Liverpool's peak Klopp years - the first-choice XI pretty much trips off the tongue.Continuity breeds consistency, right?But, given Chelsea's abundance of riches, and the number of competitive fixtures in the modern era, is having a best team really possible?Manchester City have proved over a sustained period that shuffling the starting line-up can bring emphatic success. What's more, Liverpool's reliance on a small core of players in recent years could be contributing to their collapse this season, with so many key men looking spent. ""It's over-simplistic to pick a best team,"" says ex-Chelsea forward Pat Nevin. ""You would never play the same XI in every game unless you've got a team that is so solid and unchangeable. ""Who you pick for an away game in the Champions League will be very different to the team you put out at home against a side in the bottom half of the table.""Besides, Potter famously changes personnel and styles of play all the time.""So is Chelsea's strategy of splashing huge sums of money on the world's most exciting young talents the right way to go, especially given they have spread the eye-watering cost over lucrative long-term deals?""It's massively high risk,"" concludes Nevin. ""If you buy young, unproven players on eight-year contracts, a percentage of them will fail.""But if they've got it right, it's a fantastic way to do it, and I suspect they will be quite an enjoyable team to watch.""Potter faces the delicate task of maintaining harmony in a dressing room packed full of outstanding footballers and big egos. It's a dance Nevin says comes with the territory.""That's what he gets paid a lot of money for,"" he argues. ""It's the biggest first world problem you're ever going to get. You should look at that as an opportunity, not as a problem."" So who, if everyone is fit, would be in Nevin's first-choice Chelsea side? ""I think it'll change week to week but let's consider who should be playing,"" he said. ""N'Golo Kante is the very first pick if everyone is fully fit but it's a very big 'if' for me. He'd play with Enzo Fernandez.""I think you have to play Mykhailo Mudryk and Joao Felix. They are interchangeable in their positions, and then Mason Mount has to play.""I'd put Kai Havertz up front for the moment but eventually I think he will drop into a deeper area and be one of the attacking three.""Nevin also likes the look of new centre-back Benoit Badashile, even if he could not fit into Chelsea's revised squad for the Champions League.""They are so short in defence,"" he said. ""He has been exceptionally good in his first few games and I think maybe in a year or so, he will be in a back three with Wesley Fofana and Trevoh Chalobah.""""I have to underline this does not mean that everybody else is rubbish,"" Nevin adds. ""It depends who you are playing against.""For instance, there will be plenty of games that are made for Raheem Sterling - it's never clear-cut and simple.""Sterling was the flagship signing last summer, a 27-year-old serial title-winner captured from champions Manchester City who appeared ready-made to spearhead Chelsea's revolution. One goal and one assist since August is not what Boehly will have had in mind when he sanctioned a ¬£50m purchase.His is a decorated career but, after the squad roulette of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, he may not be enjoying a similar experience in west London.The excesses of January paint the summer window in a dim light. Kalidou Koulibaly and Marc Cucurella both arrived for significant sums after the departures of Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger, but are now not guaranteed starters. And then there's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Signed as a missing piece of the jigsaw by Potter's predecessor Thomas Tuchel, he clearly does not fit with the strategy of signing young, hungry footballers - and he appears nowhere near Chelsea's first-choice XI.Nevin, however, views last summer more positively. ""In retrospect, they just needed bodies,"" he said. ""They lost two centre-backs so had to get one in. ""Some call it panic buying, I think it was security buying, but not part of a big plan.""That's the one we're seeing now.""Predict Chelsea's starting XI for their next fixture - remember you can change the formation!"
266,Women's League Cup: Liverpool & Aston Villa managers criticise competition format,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64602779,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Women's FootballWomen's Super League managers have criticised the ""unfair"" format of the League Cup after Chelsea and Arsenal reached the final.Teams in the Champions League group stage skip the League Cup groups and enter at the quarter-finals.Chelsea and Arsenal reached the final having played two games, while beaten semi-finalists West Ham and Manchester City played five and six fixtures.Liverpool boss Matt Beard said: ""They should be in all of it or not at all.""Beard believes the women's League Cup compares unfavourably to the men's, where teams in European competition enter in round three.In order to lift the trophy they must play six games, including a two-leg semi-final and the final - double the number Arsenal and Chelsea will play in the 2022-23 competition.""The format isn't fair. Chelsea and Arsenal play two games and they are in another final,"" Beard said. ""They have big squads now, 25 players and can utilise their academy.""The format of the women's League Cup - which features the 24 teams from the Women's Super League and Championship - has changed over time, with a group stage since 2017-18.However, the rule to allow clubs which qualified for the Champions League group stage to skip the first round was introduced last season.Aston Villa manager Carla Ward called for a review of the competition's structure before the 2023-24 season.She said: ""To put it politely, a competition should be one that everyone enters.

But I am not sure if me going round clapping would have shown respect.""The former Luton Town manager was subjected to chants of ""get out of our club"" after Wolves - who played for more than an hour a man light after Mario Lemina's dismissal - fought back to take all three points and leave the Saints rooted to the foot of the Premier League.It comes a week after his post-match comments, in which he claimed he had ""compromised"" his principles since arriving at the Premier League club, had further angered fans in the aftermath of a dire 3-0 loss at Brentford.The calamitous manner of this latest defeat, and ultimately losing out to a potential relegation rival, has ramped up the pressure significantly.""I couldn't feel any more pressure than I have been under this week."" Jones told Sky Sports. ""We have to keep fighting. I'm really disappointed and frustrated."" The numbers certainly do not make for pleasant reading three months after Jones was appointed.Southampton have now lost seven of their eight league games under the Welshman, whose overall record stands at nine defeats in 14 matches.Saturday's result also meant the Saints are on their worst home league run in 25 years, with their fifth successive defeat at St Mary's equalling the club's worst ever run. Their record of six points from a possible 33 available is also the worst home record in the division.However, it is not only on-field results that have raised concerns.""I don't see them staying up. I just feel Nathan Jones is too emotional,"" former Premier League defender Scott Minto told BBC Radio 5 Live.""If he's like that in a press conference, what is he like behind closed doors? I'm not sure he has the gravitas and I think he is a bit too emotional to get them to where they want to be,"" he added.""I don't just think they're going down, I think it's between them and Bournemouth for who will finish bottom.""Ex-England goalkeeper Robert Green said: ""He talks himself in and out of situations and carries on talking. Do yourself a favour and give a nice, bland, boring answer.""And speaking on Final Score, Martin Keown felt Jones' lack of top-flight experience was a factor in defeat: ""With Wolves going down to 10 men, I can't help thinking that the manager and the players are so inexperienced.""The occasion was just too big for them. Wolves, with 10 men, have given them a lesson."""

When he keeps the investment and keeps the focus in every game and brings the energy and belief in, he will keep scoring.""He has the skills to score with right, with left and with his head. It's about him getting into position.""England international Rashford now has 114 United career goals to sit 19th on the club's all-time list.And since the World Cup in particular, he has been in a rich vein of form, scoring 13 goals in 15 games. Rashford has only failed to find the net in three of those matches. Ten of them have ended in victory. Only one - at Arsenal - brought a defeat.Little wonder Ten Hag said Rashford is ""definitely one of them"", when asked if the forward is the best in Europe at present.Rashford endured a disappointing 2021-22 season, when he scored only five times in all competitions and just twice in his last 28 games of an injury-hit campaign.Even this season, Rashford only scored five in his first 13 appearances before finding the net in successive matches at the end of October.Ten Hag said he fully believed he could improve Rashford when he took charge at United last May.""I was convinced from the first moment,"" said Ten Hag. ""I was really excited to work with him. I thought I could get more out of him.""He has so many skills and such high potential and there can be even more."""

294,Dan Turner: Aston Villa defender on leaving Everton and new position,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64386274,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Women's FootballAfter spending 15 years of her career at Everton, Dan Turner admits she had become ""part of the furniture"" at the club.Taking the decision to leave last summer for a role at Aston Villa was far from an easy choice, yet so far the move is paying off.The former Blues captain has not only established herself as one of Villa's standout performers this season, she has done so in a new position - and she is relishing the challenge of proving herself again.""It gives you a bit of extra incentive to take a step further,"" the 31-year-old defender tells BBC Sport.Turner grew up playing football with her older brother in their garden in Warrington and it was not long before she was scouted by Manchester United's girls' academy. She joined Everton at the age of 15 and began a successful career in Merseyside, including a short loan spell with Icelandic team Stjarnan. While at the Toffees, Turner was part of the squad that won promotion to the WSL in 2017 and later started at Wembley in an FA Cup final defeat by Manchester City in 2020.But, while in discussions over a contract extension last summer, Turner felt it was ""time for a change"".""It goes without saying it was the most difficult decision of my career. I absolutely loved playing for Everton and I was there for half of my life,"" she says.""I think it was the right time for a change, to challenge myself and get a new lease of life. I wanted to go somewhere I maybe wasn't so comfortable.""There was interest from several clubs but a phone call from Villa manager Carla Ward convinced Turner it was the right move.""I knew her and had played against her previously so it really sparked my interest quite quickly and threw a spanner in the works. ""I was still having talks with Everton and was interested in staying but after the talk with Carla, it really kind of made the decision for me. It was what I wanted to do.""What Turner perhaps did not expect was to be thrown into a new position, having only just switched clubs.The former full-back is now starting WSL games at centre-back after a few injuries opened the door earlier in the season. ""It was actually a real positive for me. Carla showed a lot of faith in me. It's a role that I'm really enjoying and I think it suits me as a player,"" said Turner. ""The confidence I've got from my performances in the first half of the season have just made it really easy to settle. ""It feels like I've been here for a lot longer than six months. I'm loving every minute of it.""Turner has started every WSL game since joining Villa and Ward has singled her out as a contender for the England squad.""Everyone keeps saying I missed a trick moving so late in my career to centre-back - but everything happens for a reason,"" added Turner. ""It's now my preferred position. It might add a couple of years on to my career as well which would be nice.""Turner's impressive performances this season have made her a key player for Villa, who sit sixth in the WSL.Hoping to help the club climb higher up the table, Turner believes there is still more to come from her.""No matter how old you are, you can always improve,"" said Turner. ""I feel like I'm in the form of my career at the moment. I'm still learning as a centre-back for sure but I'm growing into it with each game. You can see that in the performances."""

298,Erling Haaland: Man City striker a doubt for Premier League trip to leaders Arsenal,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64619312,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Man CityManchester City striker Erling Haaland is a doubt for Wednesday's Premier League top-of-the table match at Arsenal after he was injured during the 3-1 win over Aston Villa.Haaland, who has scored 25 Premier League goals this season, came off at half-time on Sunday as City led 3-0.City boss Pep Guardiola said: ""Erling has a knock; he was uncomfortable.""""At half-time I spoke with the doctors. They said maybe with the score like it is we don't take risks, and I agreed.""Guardiola added: ""If the score was tighter, then maybe I don't do it. I think he is not injured but on Monday we are going to see.""Hopefully he can be in for Wednesday. But if he is not ready or there is some risk, he is not going to play."" City will move into top spot if they win at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal drew 1-1 at home to Brentford on Saturday, though they have a game in hand.""The team who are above us dropped points, which is why it was important to take this opportunity and finally close the gap,"" Guardiola added.""They have played one game less, so we know the distance there is - we count that we are still six points behind - but we will travel to London to try to play our game.""I feel like we have improved a lot, especially in training sessions in the last week or 10 days. Everyone is so focused, which gives us the chance to be competitive. It does not assure you to win but, without focus that is impossible.""It might not be all bad news for City if Haaland is not fit for their pivotal face Arsenal.He has not scored in any of his four away games in all competitions this year, and his mini-drought at any venue now stands at 261 minutes after he failed to find the net against Villa too.The 22-year-old did at least manage one shot on Sunday, after failing to have any efforts at goal at all  in the 1-0 defeat at Tottenham last weekend, but he can blame Riyad Mahrez for denying him another, very simple, scoring chance.Mahrez grabbed the ball after Jack Grealish was fouled in the box just before half-time and converted the subsequent penalty after refusing to give it up to Haaland or Rodri, who also wanted to take the spot-kick.Guardiola was unsure why, saying: ""Normally it is Erling who is the first taker - I wanted that to happen but Riyad always tries [to take them], and Rodri was involved.""I don't know what happened, honestly, so we will speak about it on Monday. I like it when people want to take a penalty but always there are [number] ones and the main player, that is Erling."""
299,Lack of used cars drives UK second-hand sales lower,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64586573,"Sales of second-hand cars fell sharply last year as fewer used models came onto the market, industry figures show. A shortage of parts driven by Covid meant fewer new cars were produced, and people hung on to their cars longer as they waited to upgrade. Some 6.9 million used cars changed hands, down from 7.5 million in 2021, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).However, it said the situation was starting to ease. The SMMT also said sales of second-hand electric vehicles had bucked the trend.At the height of the pandemic, car dealerships were closed and production lines shut down. Then, as the world began to open up a shortage of computer chips - which are commonly used in modern vehicles - caused further disruption. That hit the new car market, where sales slumped to a 30-year low in 2022. The shortage of vehicles fed through to the much larger second-hand market. As a result, used car prices soared in 2021 and have only just begun to stabilise. According to car magazine Autotrader, the average price of a used Fiat Panda was ¬£5,765 in January - up 18.7% compared to a year ago - while a Toyota Avensis cost ¬£5,825 - up 17.9%. However, the price of a second-hand Suzuki Vitara was ¬£14,786 - down 9% - while a Skoda Yeti cost ¬£9,893, down 9.4%.More than six and a half million used cars changed hands last year. While that's down on 2021, and still well below the pre-pandemic level, it's still an impressive number.Many people in this country, especially those who live in rural areas with limited public transport, need cars to get around. Some say the recent wave of strikes has made them more reluctant to use public transport as well.For those on lower incomes who need cheap transport, the supply shortage has been a real problem.It has pushed up the prices of many popular models at a time when the cost of living generally has been rising fast.Despite the overall slump in second-hand car sales last year, more used electric cars changed hands, the SMMT said. A record 71,071 used pure electric vehicles found new owners - up 37.5% - while sales of second-hand hybrids and plug-in hybrids rose by 8.6% and 3.6%.Electric vehicles only account for a small proportion of the used car market, but Mike Hawes, boss of the SMMT, said the uptake of used electrified vehicles ""demonstrates a growing appetite for these models"". ""With new car registrations growth expected this year, more of the latest low and zero emission models should become available to second owners,"" he said.The most popular second-hand model sold in 2022 was the Ford Fiesta, followed  by the Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen Golf, according to the SMMT. The most popular colour was black, followed by blue and grey. However, the group said some buyers had been more adventurous, with 4,461 pink, 6,708 turquoise and 18,658 bronze used vehicles changing hands during the year.Car sales hit 30-year low but electric demand soarsNissan warns costs must fall to make new cars in UK"
300,All motorcycle road racing in Northern Ireland cancelled for 2023,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64591498,"This video can not be playedFormer road racing champion Phillip McCallen says the sport must be modernised if it is to surviveMost motorcycle road racing, short circuit racing and trials in Northern Ireland have been cancelled for 2023.After an emergency meeting, the organising clubs deemed it impossible to run events because of soaring insurance charges.However, the BBC understands the organisers of the flagship North West 200 are hoping it can still go ahead.Road racing is notoriously risky, with six riders killed in the flagship race on the Isle of Man last year.Cancelled events include the Cookstown 100, Tandragee 100, Armoy Race of Legends, Ulster Grand Prix, and Sunflower trophy at Bishopscourt.The Ulster Superbike Championship is also among the events which will not take place.Motocross is not affected.The BBC understands the organisers of the North West 200, Northern Ireland's biggest outdoor sporting event, will continue to pursue every avenue to make this year's event happen. Public liability insurance covers injury to people and damage to property.The reasons for the increased premiums include instability in the insurance market and insurers getting very concerned by the number of claims in the sport.Former racing champion Phillip McCallen said it was time spectators were charged to raise funds to cover insurance costs.""It's an absolute disaster,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.""The general public have had free racing and free viewing for 50 years and some people expect that to continue but it can't.""You don't go to Windsor Park and get in for nothing, so you shouldn't have free spectating at the North West 200, for example.""It's about how we get that money from people into the organisation.""Democratic Unionist Party MP Ian Paisley, who is a keen biker, said he hoped the announcement was premature.Talks involving insurance companies in London and international companies were ongoing, he said, and there was also the possibility of extending councils' public liability insurance.Analysis by Stephen Watson, BBC Sport NIMotorcycle racing is a unique part of our sporting culture, they've been racing in this country for over 100 years.Northern Ireland has produced some of the greatest motorcyclists the world has ever seen, like five-times world champion Joey Dunlop.Racing survived the Troubles and after cancellations because of foot-and-mouth and Covid, but I fear this is biggest crisis the sport has ever faced.It's not just a hammer blow for motorcycling but also a huge blow for tourism. Unless a solution is found, the future of motorcycle racing is very bleak.Public liability insurance is now upwards of ¬£400,000.The BBC understands the motorcycle union has also been asked to pay an excess of ¬£300,000 in the result of any claim - this includes rider accidents - and ¬£100,000 excess for a property claim. So the governing body could be left with ¬£800,000 extra in costs in 2023.There are also a limited number of insurers who are prepared to underwrite motorcycle racing. The BBC understands the company who insured bike racing in Ireland last year also insured the Isle of Man TT, where six riders died.  There was also one death in the Republic of Ireland. Motorcycle Union of Ireland (Ulster Centre) chairman John Dillon said meetings had been held on Monday and Thursday.""The consensus was that the costs proposed were, at this time, unsustainable for most clubs in order to provide the required public liability cover to run our planned events,"" he said.""The MCUI (UC) will, however, continue to pursue all options for the provision of public liability insurance, should they arise in the near future.""We appreciate that this situation is far from ideal, however although we have been unable to secure the running of events for this year, this arrangement and decision will go a little way to at least allowing licence holders the opportunity to engage in competitive events, should they wish, with the appropriate cover and security.""The MCUI (UC) issues licences to motorcycle racers in Northern Ireland, which include competitive personal accident cover for riders.The union is still in the process of procuring this cover, which is a requirement for competing in races.Despite no races taking place in Northern Ireland, the cover will be needed for racers who want to compete in events elsewhere in the United Kingdom or further afield.Diesel sabotage, debts and disputes - the Mid Antrim 150North West 200 council funding gets go ahead"

Ms White has joined others in St Michael's on Wyre later, holding placards to jog people's memories.Residents have had to bring in private security following an increase in people coming to the village. It comes after Lancashire Police issued two dispersal notices on Thursday to break up groups, including amateur investigators and people filming police activity around the area where Ms Bulley disappeared.Ms Bulley was last seen on a dog walk by the River Wyre on 27 January.Police believe she fell into the river but underwater searches have failed to find her so far.They have been extended to Morecambe Bay and Knott End after Peter Faulding, head of a specialist diving team, said Ms Bulley was ""categorically not"" in the section of river where police think she fell in.Ms White told BBC Radio 4 Today: ""We just need Nikki home for her two beautiful girls who want their mummy.""It's just rollercoaster, it's almost like torture - just unimaginable frustration in the sense that everyone's come together working so hard, from the police community to people on the ground looking, you expect to be rewarded for when you put hard work in. ""So we just need something, anything - a piece of information that can lead us down a different inquiry.""Ms Bulley dropped off her daughters, aged six and nine, at school before she took her springer spaniel Willow for the riverside walk.Her phone, still connected to a work Teams call, was found on a bench on a riverbank overlooking the water, along with the dog lead and harness on the ground.Police have dismissed suggestions Ms Bulley was a victim of crime, but detectives said they remained ""fully open-minded"" to any information that indicates where she is or what happened to her.Officers previously warned members of the public not to ""take the law into their own hands"" by breaking into empty or derelict riverside properties to try to find Ms Bulley.Security service owner Spencer Sutcliffe, who offered his services for free after being approached for help by a local residents group, said local people were ""frightened"".""People have had property broken into and people have been aggressive towards residents,"" he said.He urged people not to come to the village if they don't need to and ""let the police do their job"".Lancashire Police also said it may take legal action ""where appropriate"" after a number of ""grossly offensive"" comments were made on social media.Ms White added: ""A dispersal order - what a misuse of police time and wasting valuable resources that almost take away from ultimate goal to bring Nikki home.""So we say don't speculate, don't make any conspiracy theories up and certainly don't take the law into your own hands.""If you can't be kind, don't say anything on social media.""Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

She said it may be because of hunger and often a baby can be consoled by a cuddle or a dummy, but ""this was very different"". ""This was inconsolable crying, which is extremely unusual. [Child I] was in pain and must have been in extreme pain to be that distressed."" Cross-examined by Ben Myers KC, defending Ms Letby, originally of Hereford, Dr Bohin denied that she was ""rubber stamping"" the earlier report by another prosecution expert, Dr Dewi Evans.Mr Myers said to her: ""We don't know what your conclusion would have been if you'd not been provided with Dr Evans's report first?""Dr Bohin replied: ""That's correct, but my duty is to give an independent review and that's what I've done.""

They had indicated on the rubble pile, which then led to the rescue teams to start digging.""We also brought in our colleagues who have specialist listening equipment and at that point they could hear her moving about within the rubble.""It was a seven-story building so obviously it took an incredibly long time to dig down.""My understanding is she had not long passed away whenever they recovered her this afternoon.""The victim was among more than 30,000 people who are now known to have died after two major earthquakes, measuring 7.8 and 7.5 on the magnitude scale, hit Turkey and Syria early last week.Despite the passage of time and the freezing conditions, people are still being pulled alive from the rubble, giving hope to waiting families and exhausted rescuers.Mr Gray said people in Adana were becoming increasing distraught and desperate at the sites of collapsed buildings.""The atmosphere is changing a little bit,"" he explained.""All the locals are very, very welcoming but whenever we get to a stage when we're on a rubble pile there's a lot of frustration.""It's got to the point now where we can't leave our camp without armed security guards.""That's not just us, that's all the international rescue teams that we're currently co-located with.""Mr Gray said there have been ""physical scuffles and arguments"" at sites where distressed relatives are waiting for their loved ones to be pulled from collapsed buildings.""Obviously people are at the rubble piles and they are extremely worried about their family members and friends that are buried in there, and there have been some clashes at the scene.""The team from the Bangor-based charity trained with their dogs in Northern Ireland in the days before their deployment to Turkey, but nothing could have prepared them for the scenes they are witnessing in the quake-hit area.The team is staying at a makeshift camp in the grounds of a nearby university, along with many other international search and rescue workers.""We're all in tents. It was -6C last night, I believe. It's incredibly cold."" Mr Gray said.""The atmosphere among the rescue workers is we're still cracking on, we're still doing everything we possibly can.""Obviously as time goes on it will start to move from rescue to recovery phase.""Asked how his team were coping with the extreme challenges they face, he said they were ""doing OK"" so far.""It is certainly physically dangerous. We're ok, we're still very much in work mode and we'll keep doing as much as we can for as long as we can.""On Sunday evening the men and their dogs moved on to the Turkish city of Adiyaman.They arrived at a search site just as a young child was being taken from the rubble alive.""One of the medics helped with the stretcher, he thinks it was a girl approximately seven years old,"" Mr Gray said.""So there is still hope.""NI dog team set for quake survivor searchDogs 'will try to find anybody that's still alive'The kids whose names were erased by the earthquake"
310,Scotland must rethink bottle recycling scheme - UK minister,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-64616887,"Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has urged the Scottish government to rethink its flagship recycling policy.The UK minister said the Deposit Return Scheme should be ""paused"" after business leaders raised concerns over the costs involved in setting it up.The initiative is designed to boost recycling via a 20p deposit on single-use drinks bottles and cans.Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater insisted it ""will be successful"" and would launch in August as planned.But industry critics fear it will disrupt trade, raise prices and reduce choice.Mr Jack said the Scottish government should consider waiting for a unified approach with the rest of the UK.Speaking to the Scottish Mail on Sunday, he said a UK-wide scheme - due to launch in 2025 -  would maximise environmental benefits and minimise disruption to the drinks industry.""The introduction of a Deposit Return Scheme is a challenging and complex piece of work,"" he said.""The last thing we want to do is rush into this and cause unnecessary difficulties for businesses in Scotland, particularly when many are still recovering from the effects of the Covid pandemic and are having to deal with increased costs due to the war in Ukraine.""The UK government scheme is set to launch in collaboration with the Welsh government and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland. Mr Jack added: ""It is not too late to think again and so I am calling on the Scottish government to pause its scheme and work with us to design a system that works for the whole UK.""Scotland would be the first UK nation to introduce deposit return scheme if it goes ahead in the summer.The Scottish government originally outlined plans in 2017, saying it represented ""a step change in our level of ambition"" for recycling. It was pushed back to July 2022, with the government blaming the Covid pandemic, then delayed again until August this year.Lorna Slater previously told MSPs that a number of issues were holding up the system, including Brexit.Drinks industry critics fear the scheme could create a trade barrier between Scotland and England, as it would require firms to charge higher prices north of the border.Jamie Delap, who runs family-owned Scottish brewer Fyne Ales, said the deadline for businesses to sign up was the end of this month, but many details of the scheme were still unknown.He told BBC Scotland: ""Either we sign up to a three-year legal agreement with unknown unquantifiable costs, or we don't sign up and face the possibility of not being able to sell in Scotland.""Some smaller brewers might have to increase costs up to 50%, a larger producer might increase 25%, or even more.""I can see Scottish brewers going out of business and people outside Scotland refusing to sell here.""Earlier this week, SNP MSP Fergus Ewing, former Scottish government rural affairs minister, also called for the scheme to be paused.He told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: ""The government's own review has said this cannot work. This means it is reckless going ahead. ""Surely the permanent secretary and others in St Andrews house should get out of those offices, go and speak to industry and sort it out before this disaster becomes a catastrophe.""In December the Scottish government review of the scheme found many issues were ""yet to be resolved"" and said a ""fully functioning scheme can not be in operation by August"".Mr Ewing has called for an independent review and a summit between Lorna Slater, the first minister, business leaders and the scheme's administrators.But Ms Slater insisted the August launch date would stand and said she had been spoken to industry leaders about their concerns.She told BBC Scotland: ""I know there are still some outstanding concerns, particularly from small producers.""I met with them urgently on Friday to go through those concerns, and start working on practical solutions so that all businesses in Scotland can fully participate in the scheme this August.""We have already given industry one additional year to help them recover from Covid and get ready for the scheme and we have been working very closely with them to reduce costs and make it simpler to participate.""The Scottish Liberal Democrats have also warned against the scheme's current timescale.Climate emergency spokesperson Liam McArthur MSP said: ""We have repeatedly urged the Scottish government to listen and learn from successful schemes elsewhere in Europe, but key questions remain unanswered. ""It is time ministers hit pause to avoid playing havoc with business, harming public confidence and undermining the well-intentioned case for the Deposit Return Scheme itself.""Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden added: ""This deadline is absurd, unfair and insane. ""Nicola Sturgeon must step and ditch this deadline, while her government listens properly to the dire warnings of traders.""Scottish Labour net zero spokesperson Colin Smyth said: ""Scottish Labour supports the principle of such a scheme but the current proposals are so flawed they look set to devastate business while also failing to deliver against the original ambition.""The scheme is being run by Circularity Scotland, Zero waste Scotland helped design it and advised on its implementation, while environment agency Sepa is the scheme's regulator."

Police Scotland said it had received a report and was assessing it.In a blog post on Friday, Mr Murray - who is a long-standing critic of the SNP leadership - also claimed the cache included emails between Mr McDonald and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.The Glasgow South MP told the BBC on Wednesday that his emails had been stolen last month and he feared they would be made public.The group responsible are believed to be linked to Russia's spy services.The UK's cyber-defence agency has warned about targeted attacks on politicians in recent weeks.Mr McDonald, the SNP's former defence spokesman, said he decided to go public to warn others of the risks and limit the potential damage as he waits to see what the hackers do with the stolen material.But on Friday, Mr Murray claimed he had a cache of the politician's missing emails.Writing on his blog, he said: ""I have obtained access to all of Stewart McDonald's emails, after approaching a number of people to find out who might have them.""I had no hand in obtaining the emails nor prior knowledge.

314,"Richard Sharp: BBC chairman made errors on Johnson loan, MPs say",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64610122,"BBC chairman Richard Sharp made ""significant errors of judgement"" in acting as a go-between on a loan for Boris Johnson while he was applying for the post, MPs have said.A cross-party committee said he had not given them the ""full facts"" two years ago when they were considering his suitability for the BBC role.He should consider how this affected trust in him and the BBC, it said.Mr Sharp apologised if MPs felt they had not had the details they needed.His involvement in the then-Prime Minister Mr Johnson obtaining an ¬£800,000 loan guarantee has come under scrutiny since the Sunday Times first reported the claims last month.Businessman Sam Blyth, a distant cousin of Mr Johnson and Mr Sharp's friend, had reportedly raised the idea of acting as a loan guarantor for Mr Johnson in 2020. When he appeared before MPs on the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee this week, Mr Sharp said he did not help arrange this guarantee or give Mr Johnson financial advice.He was named as the government's preferred candidate for the BBC chairmanship in January 2021 and at the time the DCMS Committee backed his appointment. The government's choice is ultimately decided by the prime minister, on the advice of the culture secretary, who is in turn advised by a panel.In its report published on Sunday, the DCMS Committee is highly critical of Mr Sharp's failure to mention any involvement he had in events surrounding the loan when they were considering his suitability for the job.The report said his decisions to ""become involved in the facilitation of a loan to the then-prime minister while at the same time applying for a job that was in that same person's gift"" and failure to disclose this to the committee undermined confidence in the public appointments process.Earlier this week Mr Sharp had told the committee he had met Cabinet Secretary Simon Case in December 2020 to get permission to pass on Mr Blyth's details to him. However, at the same meeting he had told Mr Case that he had applied for the BBC job, and therefore agreed he would have  ""no further participation"" in order to avoid any conflict of interest or perception of conflict given his application to the BBC. In its highly critical report, MPs said Mr Sharp had recognised the need to be ""open and transparent"" by bringing it to the attention of the cabinet secretary, but ""failed to apply the same standards of openness and candour in his decision not to divulge this information during the interview process or to this committee during the pre-appointment hearing [for the BBC job]"".""Mr Sharp's failure to disclose his actions to the panel and the committee, although he believed this to be completely proper, constitute a breach of the standards expected of individuals applying for such public appointments,"" the report added.The report concluded: ""Mr Sharp should consider the impact his omissions will have on trust in him, the BBC and the public appointments process.""A spokesperson for Mr Sharp said he did not facilitate an introduction between Mr Johnson and Mr Blyth and he was not involved in the arrangement of a loan between them.""Mr Sharp appreciates that there was information that the committee felt that it should have been made aware of in his pre-appointment hearing. He regrets this and apologises.""It was in seeking at the time to ensure that the rules were followed, and in the belief that this had been achieved, that Mr Sharp acted in good faith in the way he did.""The spokesperson added: ""Mr Sharp believed he had dealt with the issue by proactively briefing the cabinet secretary that he was applying for the role of BBC chair, and therefore beyond connecting Mr Blyth with Mr Case, he recused himself from the matter.""The DCMS Committee report was also critical of ministers who had defended the decision to endorse Mr Sharp in 2021 after the row over the loan broke, despite the fact they had not been told about the situation.""The fact that ministers have cited this committee's original report on Mr Sharp's appointment as a defence of the process was followed, when we were not in full possession of all the facts that we should have had before us in order to come to our judgement, is highly unsatisfactory,"" the report said.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said Mr Sharp was made BBC chairman following two ""transparent and rigorous"" appointment processes, adding the appointment was made by his predecessor. According to the Sunday Times, a leaked memo from Mr Case allegedly warned Mr Johnson to ""no longer"" ask for financial advice from Mr Sharp.But the MPs in this new report said there was an ""unresolved issue"" as to why the cabinet secretary had believed Mr Sharp had been giving financial advice to Mr Johnson and called on the Cabinet Office to ""clear up the confusion relating to the advice given to the prime minister immediately"", given that Mr Sharp had said this was not the case.Acting Chair of the DCMS Committee Damian Green MP said: ""The public appointments process can only work effectively if everyone is open and transparent, yet Richard Sharp chose not to tell either the appointment panel or our committee about his involvement in the facilitation of a loan to Boris Johnson.""A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on leaks.""For those of us following this story in detail, a fascinating element is the memo written by the Cabinet Office to Boris Johnson on 22 December 2020.  Mr Sharp is about to be announced as BBC chairman, a role appointed by the then-prime minister. So Boris Johnson is told he must ""no longer ask him advice about your personal financial matters"".Mr Sharp says he never gave Mr Johnson advice about his finances. So why is the memo phrased in that way? The committee has called upon the Cabinet Office to clear up the confusion immediately.The committee doesn't call for him to resign, but it does come close to suggesting Mr Sharp considers his position when it says he should consider the impact his actions have had on trust in him and the BBC. It is not at all certain that, even if he had declared this potential conflict of interest, somebody else would have been chosen as BBC chairman.The process, though, is under scrutiny and we now await the investigation by the public appointments watchdog.Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said the BBC chairman's position was becoming ""increasingly untenable"" and it ""throws into serious doubt the impartiality and independence that is so fundamental to trust in the BBC.""The Liberal Democrats said Mr Johnson also needed to answer questions as part of an independent inquiry.The watchdog that oversees how public appointments are made is also reviewing the process of how Mr Sharp was hired.William Shawcross, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, recused himself from heading up that review last month after writing to the DCMS to say he had met Mr Sharp on ""previous occasions"". The BBC is also conducting its own internal review over any potential conflicts of interest Mr Sharp may have in his role as BBC chairman.Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme it was important to wait for the watchdog's report.""We need to be fair to all parties in this, including Richard Sharp,"" he said. Mr Mitchell added: ""The BBC is not a silent part of all of this, the board of the BBC will need to consider what he's said and reach their own conclusions. I think the government will react appropriately to that.""BBC chairman denies arranging loan for JohnsonWatchdog review begins into BBC chairman's hiring"
315,"Turkey-Syria earthquake: UK aid is reaching Syria, minister says",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64615927,"The UK is getting aid to Syria, development minister Andrew Mitchell has said, as he defended the government's response to the earthquakes which hit the country.The tremor has added to the devastation caused by the civil war in Syria and local rescue groups have complained about the lack of international aid.More than 28,000 people have now died in Turkey and Syria after the quakes.Mr Mitchell told the BBC the UK had helped Syria from ""the beginning"".Speaking on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Mitchell said the UK's response included sending firefighters to Tukey and providing funding for major rescue operations in Syria.However, he did acknowledge that sending aid to Syria was ""much more difficult than Turkey, because it's ungoverned space there"".There has been a delay in getting aid to Syria, where years of conflict have ravaged parts of the country that remain under the control of rebels battling the government of President Bashar al-Assad, which is under Western sanctions.Some rebel-held areas in north-west Syria are already inhospitable and inaccessible after more than a decade of civil war.Currently, the UN is only authorised to use one route to deliver aid into north-western Syria, over the Turkish border into the province of Idlib.In his interview with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Mitchell was asked about the US's decision to announce a 180-day exemption to its sanctions on Syria for ""all transactions related to earthquake relief efforts"".When asked if the UK government would lift sanctions on Syria to speed up aid deliveries, Mr Mitchell said ministers would ""do everything we can to make sure aid gets through to people who are suffering"".""Specifically here, where sanctions would hold us back in any way, we would seek to have them lifted,"" the minister said.

316,UK economy narrowly avoids recession,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64584295,"This video can not be playedJeremy Hunt: ""We're not out of the woods yet""The UK narrowly avoided falling into recession in 2022, new figures show, after the economy saw zero growth between October and December.This is despite a sharp 0.5% fall in economic output during December, partly due to strike action, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the figures showed ""underlying resilience"" but said ""we are not out of the woods"". The Bank of England still expects the UK to enter recession this year.But it thinks it will be shorter and less severe than previously forecast.The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. The BBC included its view as it has a central role in managing the overall state of the economy.One of the ways it does that is by changing interest rates. Recently, it has been raising rates in a bid to tackle the soaring cost of living.Mr Hunt, who the BBC spoke to for the government's position, said that high inflation remains a problem and continues to cause ""pain for families up and down the country"".Inflation - or the rate at which prices are rising - is slowing but at 10.5% remains close to a 40-year high.The ONS, which published the economic output figures, said there was no growth in the final three months of 2022.This is the first estimate for the period and figures are often revised later on.On Friday, the ONS revised up its figures for the July to September quarter, to show that the economy shrank by 0.2% instead of the previous estimate of a 0.3% fall.A recession is typically defined as when the economy shrinks for two consecutive three-month periods. This usually means it is performing badly and companies may make less money and cut jobs, leaving the government with less tax revenue.The figures for December, however, were worse than expected, and there will be no celebrations at the Treasury.Darren Morgan from the ONS said there was a fall in health services with fewer operations and GP visits, while school attendance also dropped in the week before schools broke up for Christmas.He explained that in terms of public services, the ONS measures things like teachers' wages, and how much investment is made in schools and the health services. ""The services they provide are a really important part of the economy so we include it in our measurement,"" he said.He also said that sporting activities, particularly football, were impacted because of the World Cup.He said people were not ""able to enjoy top-flight football due to the absence of Premier League football until Boxing Day, as the World Cup continued"". Mr Morgan added that rail and postal industries ""had a poor month"". ""We certainly saw the impact of strikes as both fell heavily in December.""Strike action on trains caused disruption on the railways and on the roads in December. Postal workers also went on strike on a series of days in the run-up to Christmas.The year-on-year comparison is not the same as adding up the quarterly growth figures.It is a comparison of the full year with the full previous 12 months, which in 2021 included the lockdown at the beginning. When compared against that low base, the UK's economy was 4% bigger in 2022 than in 2021.That was the biggest increase of all G7 nations for last year. But the UK is also still the only G7 country where the economy is smaller than pre-pandemic levels.Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who we've included to explain opposing parties' point of view, warned the latest figures make for grim reading.Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said they show the economy ""is stuck in the slow lane"".She added: ""We must bring in urgent measures to prevent yet more harm from the cost of living crisis, using a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants to stop the energy price cap going up in April so that people have more money in their pockets.""Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney said: ""Britain is dangling on over the edge of a recession after months of economic vandalism and chaos in government.""The blame for these gloomy figures lies squarely with the government, who have botched budgets, failed to tackle inflation and have no plan for growth.""If you run a small business, how have you been affected by the state of the UK economy? Get in touch.Antonia Sanchez-Toomey runs Tailormade Living in Enfield, north London, a company selling items such as scented candles and accessories for the home.The BBC spoke to Ms Sanchez-Toomey ahead of the data to understand how a typical small business is faring in the current economic climate.She says it is businesses like hers that suffer when the economy shrinks and people cut back on luxuries.""We sell non-essential products,"" she says.""People are cutting back on those sorts of things. So they might still come in for a gift, but if they would buy a gift and then something for themselves, it's the 'something for themselves' that's not happening anymore.""She says in 2022, sales were down year-on-year and down by about 40% over Christmas, which she says was a shock. ""And then we've just had our quietest January ever,"" she says. ""So we've had to make lots of cuts within the business. And that has affected some of my team members. And I've just got this real sense that consumer confidence is at an all-time low.""Most forecasters now predict 2023 will see a milder downturn than previously expected because of a fall in energy prices. But some think the UK will avoid a technical recession completely. There was an upbeat take from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, an economic think tank, which forecast that the UK will swerve a recession.But both the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund were gloomier, expecting the UK economy to shrink in 2023.The UK economy is more sensitive to gas prices, to rising interest rates and has a specific issue about the failure of the workforce to return to its pre-pandemic size.The latest numbers and the early evidence from this year could still pile on the pressure for the government to do more over the workforce and over the further rise in domestic energy bills coming in the spring. Mr Hunt will outline his plans for taxation and spending in the Budget on 15 March.Separate statistics from the ONS showed that the UK's annual trade deficit for goods and services widened by ¬£85bn to ¬£108bn in 2022 when compared with the year before mainly due to a rise in the value of imports.This was largely driven by the soaring cost of food and fuel.Additional reporting by Sabina Kapoor, Priya Patel.

317,Bridgend: Surgery changes could halve waiting times,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64584359,"Changes to hip and knee surgery could halve waiting lists at one hospital within a year, say doctors.Tweaks to surgeries at the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend have allowed more patients to be sent home on the same day.Therefore, a shortage of hospital beds is not a barrier for them.It comes as over 37,000 orthopaedic patients are waiting over one year for surgery in Wales.Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Keshav Singhal said a number of ""minor tweaks"" were made to the procedure ""but all of them add up to a huge effect"".He said the anaesthetic and pain medication given to patients is ""fine-tuned"" to reduce pain and nausea after the operation and extra time is spent pinpointing any potential area of bleeding and cauterising it to ""prevent wound leakage"".""In day surgery we are not constrained by beds - there are no beds here,"" said Mr Singhal.""Patients can come in, be very well cared for in a state of the art day-surgery unit, and go home in the evening, and that totally cuts down on the inpatient beds.""Former pub owner Cheron White, 68, recently benefitted from the new system for eligible patients in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board.""It frees up beds for people who really need it,"" said the mother of five from Porthcawl. ""This is an operation, I'm not ill. Why stay in hospital if I'm not ill?""Following her surgery Ms White said: ""I want to be as mobile as possible, to thank the hospital in a way - they've given me this opportunity to be mobile. ""It was awful just sitting there, getting older and not being able to do things - it was making me feel older, but in my head I'm not an old person.""The lack of capacity in hospitals has been the catalyst for innovation in orthopaedic surgery, according to Mr Singhal.Traditionally people might have required several days in hospital after a joint replacement, but fewer beds are currently available across Wales because around 1,000 people every month can't be discharged because of the lack of social care.The numbers waiting more than a year for trauma and orthopaedic surgery in Wales currently stands at 37,396, with over a third of those waiting longer than two years.Mr Singhal explained day surgery is only suitable for patients who are relatively fit, motivated to do the rehabilitation exercises, and with family support.He explained that patient reassurance and awareness of what will happen is key.""The patients are worried - if I move around too quickly am I going to do any damage to my joint? If I move would I cause myself more pain?""Once we reassure them on those two counts and make sure the pain is controlled, their motivation kicks in. ""They know the quicker they move, the less chance of deep vein thrombosis, or wound stiffness and a quicker recovery.""While day-surgery joint replacements aren't unusual, the tweaks made have meant the hospital has been able to formalise this alternative route for some patients. This then frees up capacity on other surgical lists for those with more complex needs, who will require a bed on a ward.""Absolutely the catalyst was the absence of inpatient beds,"" said Mr Singhal. ""Because of Covid we had a whole restructuring of services, so we had to make sure that we are still able to carry on these operations without beds. This was the ideal pathway.""We hope that if we were to adopt this practice across the board, we would probably massively dent the current waiting times in Wales and indeed across the UK.""Anaesthetist Dr Gareth Parry is also part of the new system, and said the changes they've introduced have improved things for patients.""The most noticeable thing was almost 20% of people were feeling quite sick after surgery and that went down to being something that was quite uncommon,"" he said.In November there were 748,271 patient pathways awaiting treatment in Wales, which is estimated to be around 586,000 individual patients, as some patients will be on more than one ""pathway"" to treatment.Mr Singhal said day surgery for joint replacement has been done for a number of years in America and some hospitals in England have done it, but he believes they're the first to do it in an organised manner in Wales.Unite ambulance staff on second day of strikeMore cancer specialists needed in A&E, doctors sayNew medical school aims to tackle doctor shortageAdvanced paramedics try to ease pressures"

320,Protesters clash outside Merseyside asylum seeker hotel,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-64600806,"This video can not be playedWatch: Police van set on fire outside asylum seeker hotelThree people have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder following clashes outside a Merseyside hotel providing refuge for asylum seekers.A police van was set on fire after a rally against refugees and a counter-protest by pro-migrant groups took place near the Suites Hotel, Knowsley.Police said missiles were thrown at officers but there were no injuries.Protesters and counter protesters gathered at the hotel in the Ribblers Lane area at 18:30 GMT, they added.The Suites had been previously named as accommodation where asylum seekers are being housed. A couple of hours into the action, the ""initially peaceful"" protest grew violent, Merseyside Police said, leading to additional officers being called to the area. Knowsley MP Sir George Howarth called for calm, saying: ""I have referred an alleged incident posted on social media, which has triggered a demonstration outside the Suites Hotel, to Merseyside Police and Knowsley Council. ""Until the police have investigated the matter, it is too soon to jump to conclusions, and the effort on the part of some to inflame the situation is emphatically wrong.""Sir George added: ""Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community.""The BBC is yet to establish the nature of the protest.Clare Moseley, founder of refugee charity Care4Calais, told the BBC she had been part of a counter-protest in solidarity with migrants. She said she was ""deeply shocked and shaken"" to see ""hundreds"" of protesters, who she described as ""far-right"", angry at migrants in the hotel. The protesters had broken through police lines to surround the hotel at around 20:15 GMT, Ms Moseley added, describing the scene as ""like a war zone"". She said: ""The far-right people were very organised and very violent. ""All you could hear was fighting in every direction. Fireworks going off, banging, rocks flying, smashing glass, and you could hear people shouting.""The police van went right up in flames and exploded, then [the protesters] broke through again and started fighting with the police.""She added that counter protesters had been ""barricaded in a car park"". ""We were stuck there for ages, whilst the police were fighting in different areas.""I was really frightened for us, I was really frightened for the people in the hotel. These are people who have come from war zones. I can't imagine how terrifying it would be for them.""The three people who were arrested have been taken to police stations for questioning.A man who was staying at the hotel when the protests broke out said people were ""crying and suffering"" during the violence.The man from East Africa, who had been accommodated at Suites Hotel for the past seven months and did not want to be named, told PA news: ""It was burning and everybody in the world was praying.""We come from different lifestyles so it doesn't surprise me to see a vehicle burning.""He added that despite Friday night's events, ""people have been welcoming here"". Ahmed, who did not want to give his second name, said he had been staying at the hotel for a month after travelling from Egypt, where he was a teacher.The 34-year-old said others staying in the hotel included doctors and engineers, adding: ""I was afraid. We came to the UK for safety.""Knowsley Council said it had been given less than 48 hours' notice in January 2022 of the Home Office's intention to temporarily accommodate asylum seekers at the hotel.It is understood the government appointed private company Serco to manage the hotel site and provide support to asylum seekers there.Knowsley Council said it was ""not involved in that contract"" and was not being paid to accommodate asylum seekers, but said it was committed to supporting people fleeing persecution.The government has been accommodating asylum seekers in Knowsley since 2016, the council said.The BBC has contacted the Home Office for a response.Chief Constable of Merseyside Police Serena Kennedy said there would be ""an increased police presence"" over the weekend. She tweeted: ""We will be continuing in our identification of those mindless individuals who were responsible for the offences this evening.""Assistant Chief Constable Paul White said the incident was ""completely unacceptable"" and put ""those present, our officers and the wider community in danger"". ""For officers and police vehicles to be damaged in the course of their duty protecting the public is disgraceful,"" he said.  By Nick Garnett, North of England reporter The husk of a police van lies burnt to the metal outside the gates of the Suites Hotel.From a window, a man staying at the hotel peers down at the debris below. Bottles, paving stones, rocks and sticks litter the roads, the aftermath of the violence.  Police allow me through to see what happened but only when they've taken three young men they've just arrested into the back of a waiting police van which then drives off.  On the road, a piece of paper flutters by. ""This is our city"" it says, hinting at the issues which may be involved in this protest. Police are continuing to review evidence of the incident, and are asking the public to contact them directly with any information, rather than posting it on social media. A number of road closures have been in place on the East Lancs Road and police urged motorists to avoid the area. Merseyside's police commissioner Emily Spurrell, who oversees Merseyside Police and is appointed through a public vote, called the incident ""deeply shocking"" and added ""there is absolutely no excuses for this"". And shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called the behaviour of protesters ""shameful and appalling"".Mark Davies, of the Refugee Council, said those who had participated had brought ""shame on this country's long and proud record"" of helping those in need.""These are appalling scenes and our thoughts are with those staying at the hotel. This must be terrifying for them.""Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram? You can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.ukAre you in the area?

322,"Keep vapes out of sight of children in shops, say councils",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64597395,"Vapes should be kept out of sight of children in shops and the legal minimum age of 18 should be marked clearly on each product, say councils in England.Too many children are being illegally sold vapes with fruity flavours and colourful packaging, they say.Doctors have warned of the potential long-term effects of vaping on the lungs, and are calling for tighter rules on packaging and advertising.Vapes should only be used by smokers who want to give up tobacco.In the UK, only those aged 18 and over can buy vapes or e-cigarettes.But vaping is growing in popularity among teenagers, who often use disposable single-use products like Elf and Geek bars.They come in a variety of flavours and colours, are marketed on social media and can be bought in many High Street shops, such as newsagents or mobile phone outlets. They cost about ¬£5.The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England, is calling for vaping products to be subject to the same rules as cigarettes - sold in plain packaging and kept out of reach and sight of children behind shop counters.Vapes or e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes because they do not contain harmful tobacco, or produce dangerous tar or carbon monoxide from tobacco smoke.However, they usually contain the addictive substance nicotine and, if the devices used are illegal, they can also contain potentially dangerous levels of that and other ingredients. Health experts say vaping is not risk-free. Young people who vape regularly have reported getting nosebleeds, headaches and sore throats. Others say they feel like they are addicted.""It is not right that stores are able to prominently display vaping paraphernalia for all to see, such as in a shop window, often in bright, colourful packaging that can appeal to children,"" said councillor David Fothergill, chairman of the LGA's Community Wellbeing Board.He also said it was ""deeply worrying"" that more and more children who had never smoked are starting to vape.Health charity Ash, which has been providing resources for schools, parents and teachers on how to stop children vaping, says the government should introduce a tax on single-use disposable vapes in the Budget in March.""In one simple step this would reduce both child vaping and the vast quantities of single-use vapes being thrown into landfill,"" says chief executive Deborah Arnott.The charity also suggests product names resembling sweets or featuring cartoon characters should be banned, and anyone who looks under 25 should be asked for ID in shops.Trading Standards recently said that one in three businesses has been found to break the law over under-age sales of vaping products, and it wants to see them face tougher penalties. It is also regularly seizing lorry loads of counterfeit and illegal vapes from shops across the country, as well as at Channel ports.Some 8.6% of 11 to 18-year-olds in England are vaping, latest figures show, up from 4% in 2021. Among adults, it is about 7%.More than half of all current young vapers use disposable vaping products, compared with just 7.8% two years ago.The Scottish government says it will consider a potential ban on disposable vapes as part of a plan to reduce their impact on public health and the environment.In October, the Irish government launched a consultation on banning ""wasteful"" disposable vape products, citing concerns over littering.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care in England said tough regulations on advertising vaping products to children, nicotine strength, labelling and safety were already in place.They added: ""We are carefully considering the recommendations from the Khan review: making smoking obsolete, including what more can be done to protect children from vaping.""The UK Vaping Industry Association said the solution is to enforce existing laws on retailers rather than focus on packaging.It says it is developing detailed proposals for the government to consider - ""including substantial on the spot fines and nationwide retail licensing and test purchasing schemes"".It also maintains that disposable vapes are not just being used by young people - they are also sought after by older adults too.Illegal vape sales are High Street's biggest threatYoung non-smokers told not to take up vapingShould disposable vapes be banned?Market flooded by unsafe vapes aimed at childrenVaping - is it a risk-free option?Nicotine vaping in England 2022 evidence update main findings - GOV.UKUKVIA ‚Äì UK Vaping Industry AssociationConsumer Help and Advice - CTSI - Chartered Trading Standards Institute UK"

However, the Scottish government said it was not involved in the appointment of the KC.The contract process for the two passenger ferries, the Glen Sannox and the unnamed 'hull 802', has also been investigated by MSPs on Holyrood's public audit committee.CMAL has defended the procurement and said an audit in 2018 found ""no adverse issues"".However, the BBC documentary Disclosure: The Great Ferries Scandal uncovered evidence of a number of irregularities:The Glen Sannox and hull 802 are being built at the Ferguson Marine shipyard at Port Glasgow.The yard collapsed into administration and was nationalised in 2019 amid an dispute between former owner Jim McColl and the ferries agency CMAL, who both blamed each other for the problems.A spokeswoman from CMAL said: ""CMAL has instructed its lawyers Addleshaw Goddard to appoint a King's Counsel to conduct an independent investigation relating to the procurement process. ""We are unable to comment further while this investigation is ongoing.""The public audit committee is due to report on its inquiry into the delays to the delivery of the two ferries next month. Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said procurement process had been ""mired in secrecy and evasiveness"".He said: ""MSPs should be able to question the KC appointed once they have completed their work and there should be parliamentary scrutiny of the final report.""""The government should commit to following their recommendations as well as any recommendations made by the committee when they report."""

327,WRU member called rugby referee Nigel Owens homophobic names - claim,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64599286,"More people have spoken about alleged sexism and bullying at the Welsh Rugby Union with claims homophobic language was used about referee Nigel Owens.An ex-colleague claimed the use of homophobic names for Mr Owens went unchallenged in the office.Another staff member told BBC Wales she had been left ""broken"" by her time at the union.Acting WRU chief executive Nigel Walker apologised for the actions, attitudes and behaviours described. Nigel Owens told the BBC Newsnight programme the Welsh Rugby Union needed to investigate any allegations of homophobia, but added he had always felt supported by the organisation.An independent panel, led by Dame Anne Rafferty, looking into the culture at the WRU is due to start work on Monday after a tumultuous few weeks which saw the union's chief executive Steve Phillips resign.It follows a BBC Wales Investigates programme last month and since then BBC Wales has been contacted by a number of former employees at the union.Warning: This story contains offensive languageJen, not her real name, worked for the union trying to grow the sport with young people until 2021 but quit after the job left her ""broken"" and she suffered burnout. She said it was her ""dream job"" but it eventually took over her life, working 70-hour weeks.""I felt the pressure constantly. At one point I was the only female officer. It felt like it was a tick box exercise: 'send Jen here because she's female', 'send Jen here because she can deal with the girls' side of stuff'.""I was just constantly battling, and losing confidence along the way, because I thought 'people are not listening to me, am I not doing a good job?' I just felt I was getting nowhere,"" she said.As part of her role Jen said she tried to make clubs and coaches aware of how training may need to be adapted around a woman's menstrual cycle but said she got ""laughed at"".She also described a meeting where she faced sexist attitudes while talking about the issue of women's periods and sport. ""It was quite intimidating anyway. I was the only female officer on the call,"" she said, adding she had done a presentation and had been ready to ""take on the world"" but was then ""shot down"".""I introduced myself and then the comment I got was 'ah, isn't it nice to see that a woman is working hard and not busy in the kitchen?' I instantly froze. I couldn't say anything, I was in shock.""Jen later complained to her manager and the person who made the comment was asked to apologise.But she said the damage had been done because it was not challenged during the initial call in front of others.  Ultimately, Jen said she felt completely unsupported by the WRU.  ""There was one point I think it was not long before I left the union and I was just sitting in a car park, exhausted, mentally and physically. ""I was going through a tough time. I went to the office and asked to see my manager, just to explain that I could do with a bit of time out, I think my mental health has deteriorated and I think I need a bit of support, this is getting too much of a big job and I still remember he just laughed in my face and said, 'well that's the work that we're doing'.  ""For me to ask for help was a big question - and that broke me."" Jen left the WRU two years ago but the experience has had a big impact.""Since that day, I would not advise anyone to work for the union. It's not good for you. I was angry for a long time. I had to stop playing.  ""I couldn't even go to the local rugby club because everything with rugby was just taking me back. I lost a lot of confidence in myself. ""I am so grateful that it's finally come out - the cracks have been showing for a while but it needs to explode first and people need to be aware of what's happened.""Acting CEO Nigel Walker said: ""It is extremely harrowing to hear of the experiences these individuals have endured. ""The behaviour described has no place in society, at the Welsh Rugby Union nor in Welsh rugby. We wholeheartedly condemn these attitudes and behaviours."" Martyn Lewis was a referee until 2016, overseeing Welsh Premiership games and as assistant referee for regional games.The 55 year-old said certain individuals within the union had too much control and described hearing homophobic language with a colleague repeatedly referring to referee Nigel Owens as ""the gay boy"".Nigel Owens came out in 2007 and retired from refereeing international matches in 2020.""When that's everyday speech in the office environment around the union -  and this isn't something that was just said on the odd occasion, this is said in front of everybody in the business.  ""And to have not been brought to task on that really shows the culture of people not being stood up to,"" said Mr Lewis.""And frankly those in senior positions should have sort of cut that out anyway.""Nigel Owens told Newsnight he knew nothing about people using homophobic slurs about him within the organisation.But it was ""distressing and very disappointing"" to hear about such comments, he said.""From my 22 years in working in the Welsh Rugby Union as a professional rugby referee, I've only had a huge amount of support from the Welsh Rugby Union,"" he said.The organisation had changed a lot since he came out, he added.""There was nobody out [as gay] in the macho world of rugby. You have to remember things are very different now.""Things have changed, there is a lot of work to do again but things are much better now than they were back then. It's an ongoing process.""From his experience, rugby was a diverse sport, he said, but he added there would always be ""a minority of people who are just not nice people in all walks of life"".Mr Lewis, who now lives in Canada, said he tried to call the person using homophobic language out but it was never tackled at a more senior level. He also said that professionalism was lacking in many areas of the union and that it was ""run like a bunch of amateurs"". Revelations in recent weeks did not surprise him.""I would question anybody that's been part of the part of the union to act surprised and if they were genuinely surprised, they didn't walk around with their eyes open.""Mr Lewis ended up making an official complaint to the union in 2016 after having his licence taken away which he believes happened because he spoke out against a more senior colleague.It was reinstated after he got a law firm involved and he believes the complaint wasn't investigated properly.  ""It's very much a society of covering up and that's really the frustration,"" he recalled.  He has already been in contact with the review panel and thinks people need to get involved.  ""I encourage anybody to contact them, to get involved. It is difficult, especially if you're still involved in the environment,"" said Mr Lewis.""So you have to be a strong individual, to stand up and speak out.""Mr Walker said: ""We work hard on equality, diversity and inclusion throughout the WRU, but we also know that we have let individuals down in the past and also in very recent history. That is why we have determined that an independent review is essential. ""The Rt Hon Dame Anne Rafferty DBE PC has been appointed as chairwoman of the Independent Review Panel and its full terms of reference have been published. ""We welcome this intervention and look forward to its recommendations and to implementing necessary change. ""Finally, it is important for those of us here now at the WRU to sincerely apologise for the actions, attitudes and behaviours described.

328,Earthquake tears apart a Turkish-British family,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64618187,"Warning - this piece contains details that some readers may find distressing.We look back on the city of Gaziantep and drive deeper into the snow-flecked mountainside of south-eastern Turkey.It is increasingly remote terrain, yet it feels so familiar - village after village bearing the same devastating scars.We stop at a small place we learn is called √ñrdekdede and stumble into a Turkish community where their dead now outnumber the living.This is a grim new reality for so many dots of the map across the huge corridor of this region where the ground shook most violently.The last people we expect to find among the survivors in this secluded spot - huddling around a fire, sipping tea - are two Londoners.Mehmet and Fatma Meter are from Finsbury Park, north London.""This earthquake has destroyed everything,"" says Fatma, as she wipes tears with her scarf. ""We arrived in Turkey before the earthquake for my brother's funeral,"" Mehmet explains. ""But now we've had to bury seven of our family."" They take us on a journey to document where each precious life was lost.  So we pick our way through their decimated community, which is now a grotesque jumble of broken bricks, twisted metal and dusty rubble.Fatma leads us along the path before stopping, pointing to a corner of the wreckage where she says the first of three relatives perished.""We tried to save them.

Roads minister Richard Holden praised the pilot but said he was ""at the mercy of the Treasury"". Mr Sherriffe, whose charity has invested in the scheme along with Carefree Cornwall, bus operators and Cornwall Council, said there had been some ""amazing stories"" of people in Cornwall benefiting from free travel. He said with the average weekly cost of a bus pass now at ¬£18, the scheme was ""tremendously important"" to help people access jobs and become ""economically independent"".""There was a lovely story of someone who was homeless and can now access mental health services and is in a much better position,"" he added. ""We all know what's happening with children and young people with mental health today.""These people can now access services that they couldn't because they simply could not afford the bus fare.""Speaking at the Go Cornwall bus depot in Truro, Roads Minister Richard Holden said other parts of the country, including Gateshead and Newcastle, had been looking to ""follow Cornwall's lead"" with the scheme. He said young people were ""particularly vulnerable"" when leaving the care system or families who had cared for them and that the scheme was a bridge into employment and education.He added: ""I'm always at the mercy of the Treasury for funding but I will always push for local transport and local transport schemes, particularly when it affects vulnerable transport users.""Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

330,Nurses strike: A&E and cancer staff could join further walkouts,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64614463,"Nurses from A&E, intensive care and cancer wards could join fresh strikes in England, as a major nursing union considers escalating its pay dispute.The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) wants higher wages, but ministers argue that pay is set by an independent body.The union is considering a continuous 48-hour strike, which could begin in weeks.However, under union law staff would need to meet minimum legal levels of care.This involves providing cover for the most urgent clinical situations as part of an obligation not to endanger life. ""Our priority is keeping patients safe,"" the Department of Health said, adding the NHS has ""tried-and-tested plans"" to minimise disruption. The action being considered would go on for longer than the recent strikes held in December and last week, which each lasted 12 hours. The RCN also said it may not make local agreements to help NHS managers during the strike periods, as it has done before.In previous action, there were about 5,000 cases where the strike was not fully implemented which were decided through joint committees of NHS and RCN staff.A Royal College of Nursing source said NHS leaders are ""fearing this escalation"" and ""must bring pressure to bear on government to get it stopped"".The union would have to give two weeks' notice for any action. Dates have not yet been set, it is understood, but could be announced within days.The RCN says it is frustrated that the government has refused to discuss increasing the 4% pay offer already made for the current 2022-23 year. Strikes in Wales have been called off after offers of a 7% pay increase, while nurses in Scotland who are members of the RCN and GMB unions are not holding strikes while negotiations take place.The Department for Health has indicated there is no change in its position for nurses in England, including on pay for the current year - one of the main contentions in the dispute. It said Health Secretary Steve Barclay would discuss pay for the coming year, and urged unions to call off their strikes.Earlier this month, the RCN's general secretary Pat Cullen wrote to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak asking for talks. The union said it has had no reply. On Saturday night, Downing Street said it would not add another level of negotiation into the process, and the health secretary would respond to the letter in due course.NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said the only way to avoid more disruption was by having fresh pay talks.Its deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said a 48-hour strike ""would likely have the biggest impact on patients we've seen"".""This will be significantly compounded if junior doctors also vote to strike from next month, further derailing efforts to tackle care backlogs.""When are the NHS strikes and what does it mean for patients?Nurses call on Sunak to make new pay offer"
331,Ban on Edinburgh lap dancing clubs overturned after judicial review,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-64596835,"A ban on lap dancing clubs in Edinburgh that was due to come into force later this year has been overturned.Councillors voted to limit the number of sexual entertainment venues (SEVs) in the city from the current four to zero from April.A group of club owners and performers launched a legal challenge to the move.The Court of Session agreed with them that the city council had acted illegally by effectively banning lap-dancing clubs.Lord Richardson ruled that the council's plan to stop awarding licences to adult entertainment venues - the so called nil cap - was unlawful.He also concluded that councillors had been given incorrect legal advice about the impact of the decision they had made in March of last year. The legal representatives believed that the council could still award licences to adult entertainment venues on a discretionary basis. But lawyers for four Edinburgh based venues - including the Burke and Hare, the Western Bar and Diamond Dolls - believed this was incorrect and that the decision meant that their venues would not be allowed to operate.They argued that the council's plan would put the jobs of 100 women at risk.In a lengthy written ruling, Lord Richardson agreed that the council's decision amounted to an unlawful ban on adult venues in Edinburgh. He added: ""I do not consider that the respondent (the council) has put forward a good reason why the erroneous decision should not be quashed"".A crowd-funded judicial review was heard at the court in early December. Members of the United Sex Workers (USW) union highlighted concerns about its members potentially having to work in unsafe, unregulated environments if the three remaining adult venues in the city were forced to close. The union said workers were ""incredibly pleased"" at the court's ruling as the closure of all lap dancing clubs in the city would have ""meant many of our members losing their livelihoods or having to move away from their homes and families to find work elsewhere"".It added: ""Not only is this a huge win for strippers in Edinburgh, who are no longer facing the prospect of forced mass-unemployment in the middle of a recession, but for the working rights of strippers across Britain.""Nil-caps are a violent, anti-worker policy that removes strippers' access to safe workplaces, workers rights and their ability to improve their own working conditions. ""Now they have been found unlawful, we hope this puts an end to local councils imposing strip club bans and closing down our places of work, for good.""Erin, an Edinburgh-based stripper, told BBC Scotland the last year had been ""very distressing"" not knowing if her employment venues would be shut down.""I was looking to have to move in April to somewhere else where strip clubs are allowed, because I have no intention of stopping being a dancer,"" she said. ""But there are other women who are mothers and have families here who don't have that option. They would just be forced out of work and into the benefits system.""It has been stressful. I have been part of the union and fighting this from day one. We raised the money for the legal fees in four weeks - the public support has been amazing - but even then, the council tried to block us being part of the judicial review. They didn't want to hear our voices. ""We didn't know which way it as going to go so it's absolutely amazing. It is good for Edinburgh but also good for sex workers around the UK. ""If it is unlawful in Edinburgh, it should be unlawful in any city. So it is a massive step forward for us as strippers and sex workers as a union.""I have done this job for 15 years and I continue to want to do it. I know it is not for everybody but it creates options for women who wouldn't have opportunities elsewhere. To take that away from women would just be wrong.""The violence against women argument has been debunked. The cities where strip clubs have been closed, violence against women has gone up. ""If this ban had gone through, we would have been pushed into working in underground, dangerous places with no CCTV and no bouncers. Here we have safety and the other girls are looking out for you.""I feel safer in a strip club than I do a normal bar. If somebody tries to grab you here, I can tell the bouncers and they get thrown out. We actually have the power in strip clubs.""   Steve MacDonald from the Club Operators Action Group, which brought the legal action, said it would work with the regulatory committee and licensing board to continue providing ""a proven safe working environment for all our staff members, customers and particularly our performers"". The council's regulatory committee originally voted by a majority of five to four to effectively ban the clubs, but its membership has changed since May's local elections.Earlier this week the new committee backed a 12-week consultation - once the outcome of the judicial review was known - to allow the council to review the policy.A City of Edinburgh Council spokesman said: ""We have received the ruling of the judicial review which we are considering in detail before deciding on our next steps.""The Scottish government brought in laws in 2019 allowing councils to limit the number of lap dancing venues.In March last year, Glasgow City Council agreed to allow the city's three lap dancing clubs to continue trading, and awarded licences for the first time in September.Public to have say on Edinburgh lap dancing clubsEdinburgh moves to license its lap dancing barsCouncil asks for power to license lap dancing barsCall for lap dance club restrictions"

333,"Disabled woman made 1,000 calls for Ed Sheeran tickets",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64236968,"This video can not be playedKat Watkins had to try 1,000 times to secure tickets by phone to watch Ed Sheeran in concert.Kat Watkins is a woman who likes to live life to the full.She's visiting South Africa in the spring, then it's France for the Rugby World Cup, where she hopes to see Wales in the final, having bought a ticket.Kat also travels around the UK from her Swansea home to the theatre, museums, spas and concerts. But as she is a wheelchair user, Kat can't get tickets by clicking a website link like most people - watching Ed Sheeran took 1,000 phone calls.Because she needs a personal assistant to accompany her, Kat, like other disabled people, generally has to ring up ticket offices.This means being restricted to office hours only - trickier if you work full-time - and having to get through phone systems.This hasn't dampened her love of watching concerts, with Kat having seen Take That six times, as well as Westlife and JLS.While she praises Cardiff's Principality Stadium for offering accessible tickets for Ed Sheeran's mega-concerts without having to provide proof of disability, getting hold of them was another matter. ""I would ring, get 'beep, beep, beep', hang up - and it took 1,000 attempts,"" she said. ""And then when I got through to the wait, it was another 40 minutes. And luckily there were tickets left.""Kat did manage to get tickets to Tom Jones and Stereophonics quicker, but was again frustrated she could not simply book online.The Principality Stadium said it currently dealt with tickets via the phone to understand customers' needs, but added it was planning on moving the purchase of accessibility tickets online.When Kat visited the O2 arena in London to watch Take That's Mark Owen, she had to send her personal independence payment award through to prove her entitlement. This is a common procedure, but requires people to do it repeatedly for different events.Wales has made some progress in trying to ease the process, with the Arts Council of Wales establishing the Hynt scheme which offers people with disabilities a card showing their entitlement to carer tickets. They only have to provide proof once when first applying.Kat said it has removed a lot of the bureaucracy involved in getting tickets. However, even with the card, it doesn't automatically give people the opportunity to book online at many of the venues.An exception is Cardiff's Wales Millennium Centre - once a person registers the card, all they have to do is sign in online to be offered wheelchair or regular seats with a free companion ticket. At the two biggest football clubs in Wales, Cardiff and Swansea, the contrast is marked.Cardiff City's Disabled Supporters Association (DSA) has been in talks with the club for years about getting an online system in place, but fans needing a carer still have to ring or visit the ticket office.In contrast, Swansea City decided in 2016 to develop its own bespoke ticketing system, with users registering their details and eligibility once to gain online ticket access.A club spokesman said after they have provided supporting documents to show their accessible needs, they are able to log into their account to get tickets.In 2016, Swansea was the first Premier League club to provide the service and shared it with others.As an IT specialist, Kieran Jones from Cardiff City DSA finds it frustrating the club had not yet managed to set up a comprehensive online booking system, despite the fact people who need disabled spaces just for themselves can book online.""The ticket office moved to a new system and they're still working with it,"" he said. ""It's the same system that Wales, the FAW [which uses Cardiff City Stadium for matches], have got so it will eventually allow people to book with a carer, but currently they haven't got that far.""A Cardiff City spokesman said as a Premier League club in 2016, Swansea was in a different income bracket to Cardiff and had more potential to invest in ticketing.However, he added ""significant steps towards improvement"" have been made over the past couple of seasons.Alexandra Osborne from Disability Wales describes the ticketing situation at venues as a ""big issue, and has been long term"".""An awful lot of our members, disabled people from across Wales, are saying that they missed out on another gig, or another concert, "" she said.""You've always got to spend quite a long time looking it up before the tickets come out to make sure you don't end up missing out because you've called a number that last time is fine but this time is the wrong number.""Ms Osborne would like to see online and phone booking options available for disabled people.She believes one single UK-wide access card, similar to Hynt but valid for all venues, would make a positive difference.""It's a lot of work to apply for them all and then keep up, to make sure your passes haven't expired,"" she explained.""If there was one pass so we could use it in any registered venue, I think it would just help with the awareness and people actually using them because it would be talked about a bit more.""Theatre tickets 'Wild West' for disabled customersDisabled fans affected by access issues'I want playgrounds that everyone can enjoy''It's such a humiliating experience'"

""We pursued these connections and worked with partners from all those countries to help build the intelligence picture around him.""We have been supported by the public who responded to the media and Crimewatch appeals to provide intelligence all of which has ultimately led to his capture.""Lorry drivers Lesley Muffett, 59, of Campbell Road, Witham, and Stuart Davidson, 65, of Chesham Drive, Basildon, as well as Darren Keane, 34, of Kiln Drive, Milton Keynes, were convicted of their involvement alongside the absent Wakeling after a 12-week trial.

The blast broke some car windows, affected scaffolding on the under-construction road bridge, and damaged the flood wall.Residents have been allowed to return to their homes and the army has been leaving the site.Norfolk Police said the army specialists ""always planned for the possibility"" of the bomb detonating. No-one was injured in the blast, Norfolk Police said.Environment Agency engineers would inspect the damaged river wall, but initial assessments showed the flood defence had not been compromised, police added.Debris has been cleared from the road and the nearby tower crane was checked to ensure it was still safe.This video can not be playedWatch: WW2 bomb goes off in unplanned detonationSherylanne Hodgins is manager and owner of Avery Lodge care home on Southtown Road which was just inside the larger cordon.

340,New rail strikes ballot to start soon - RMT's Mick Lynch,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64609236,"Rail workers will be balloted ""soon"" on whether to stage fresh strikes later in the year, the RMT union's general secretary Mick Lynch has said.Mr Lynch told the BBC the union wanted to ""keep talking"" about pay, but felt the government was ""trying to make an example out of the railways"".On Friday, the union rejected what was described as a ""best and final"" offer from the body representing rail firms.The government and Network Rail have condemned the decision. Mr Lynch branded the offers ""dreadful"", while Transport Secretary Mark Harper called the union's decision ""a kick in the teeth for passengers"".The long-running dispute over pay, job cuts and changes to working conditions has led rail workers from a number of unions to strike over numerous days since the summer.  No further strikes are currently planned by the RMT - Britain's largest rail workers' union - but it has a mandate to call further strikes up until May.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Lynch said a new ballot process would be sought so there was an overlapping ""continuous mandate"" for industrial action.He went on: ""We did put it [the pay offer] to our members. There was a universal rejection of what's on the table.""He said staff ""feel under attack"", and some had not had a pay rise for the last four years. But he added the RMT ""want to keep talking"" to the rail companies, despite fears ministers were trying to make an example out of the rail dispute.""Ministers have told me that face to face - Mark Harper and (transport minister) Huw Merriman - that they can't offer us anything fresh because it would set a precedent for nurses and other public sector workers, and they want to hold this line.""Network Rail and the Rail Delivery Group, which represent train companies, have offered striking workers a pay deal worth 9% over two years.But unions have said that any pay offer should reflect the rising cost of living - as inflation sits above 10%.Mr Lynch described the offer as ""very puny"", saying it did not meet members' expectations ""on pay, job security or working conditions"".The RMT said it would now seek further meetings with Network Rail and the RDG to try to work towards a settlement.The latest pay offer did not go to a vote of the full RMT membership.Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: ""It is now clear that no realistic offer is ever going to be good enough for the RMT leadership.""And Tim Shoveller, Network Rail chief negotiator, said the RMT was ""condemning its members to a further round of fruitless, pointless and costly strikes"".""We have made multiple concessions, compromises and offers, while the RMT has shifted on nothing. It's time for a second referendum on our new, revised offer and time to end this and work together to rebuild our railway.""Mr Lynch said pay offers without conditions attached had been made in Wales and Scotland - where there is no Department for Transport oversight - and that ""something more along those lines"" would be more acceptable.Meanwhile, negotiations are ongoing for other rail workers. The drivers' main union, Aslef, says it hopes to have more talks next week. And a smaller union, the TSSA, said on Friday that thousands of its members would be given a vote on the offers from the train companies.When are the next train strikes?RMT rejects pay offer to end strikesNew powers to curb strike disruption passed by MPs"

352,"Brexit: Northern Ireland Protocol talks at their end stages, sources say",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64603733,"Northern Ireland Protocol talks are in their end stages, according to two sources with knowledge of negotiations.One suggested a legal text is now being looked at where the final, binding details are nailed down.However, it is also cautioned there are still things to square off to ensure an agreement is sellable - to EU member states as well as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Tory MPs.Downing Street continues to insist that there remains lots of work to do.The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in 2019 to ensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit.However, it means there are new checks and controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.The protocol is opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland, most notably the largest unionist party, the DUP, which is preventing a government from being formed in Northern Ireland as a protest.The language surrounding the talks has become increasingly positive, with striking words from the EU on Friday. The European Commission Vice-President Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, who has led EU negotiations, said the talks had been ""hard work"" but that it was ""time well invested"". It followed a video call between him, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.Often there are stock phrases that Mr ≈†efƒçoviƒç has used after such calls, but that is not one of them.One source repeated claims that a framework deal has been on Rishi Sunak's desk for some time but that the prime minister was waiting for the right moment to move forward. All sides are highly aware that a compromise may prove hard to sell to the DUP or the Conservatives' Brexit hard-line European Research Group (ERG), and there are still big question marks over what a potential agreement might look like. The two sides are believed to have settled on red and green lanes as a method of reducing checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland.  It has been reported that will govern animal health and food safety as well as customs formalities. On governance, Britain had previously backed down on its demand to remove the European Court of Justice as the final arbiter of the treaty but had still sought options for a more 'arms-length' arrangement. EU officials have always been extremely clear that the court must have the final say on single-market issues, but there is debate over whether its role could be softened.Interestingly, there has been no suggestion that negotiators are rewriting the original treaty - instead, it appears they are seeking to add to or clarify it. Britain had originally said that the problems with the treaty were ""baked in"" to the text and therefore it needed a fundamental revision. If the text is not being significantly rewritten, it is possible that any deal could just be ratified through the protocol's Joint Committee rather than requiring votes in London and Brussels.The foreign secretary, Mr Cleverly, said on Friday that any agreement must address the ""full range of challenges"". That suggests he is against signing up to an agreement that deals comprehensively with some issues - such as customs checks - but leaves open others, such as governance. One source suggested that while some solutions on the table were durable, others might need longer-term engagement.Some UK officials have suggested it would be ""risky"" to take that kind of incremental approach because the EU might not want to come back for further talks, once its main concerns are addressed. EU officials have also hinted that there had been much more thorough progress in some areas than others but expressed reluctance at the idea of having to keep revisiting any deal in future.The comprehensiveness of the agreement, therefore, may be an ongoing point of tension. European diplomats have long warned that the negotiations are a ""high-wire"" act - a sentiment recently echoed publicly by the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""You know the principle that everything is only negotiated at the very end - when you know what the result is and you give a final signature,"" she said.A simple guide to the Northern Ireland ProtocolNI Protocol talks 'gradual and incremental'Protocol doesn't change constitution, court told"

It is collapsed on entry and pushed up into the IVC to expand to its full size.The patient wears an external detection belt across the abdomen for one to two minutes a day to power the implanted sensor via radiofrequency energy.The data is then sent to medical staff at UHS.Dr Flett said: ""This innovative new device has the potential to improve patient safety and outcomes in the management of patients with chronic heart failure and we are delighted to be the first site in the UK to implant as part of this ground-breaking study.""He said a second patient had since received the implant.""We look forward to receiving [the data] so that we can intervene earlier in a bid to reduce hospital visits and keep patients well for longer,"" he added.UHS admits 700 patients with heart failure every year.About 900,000 people are living with heart failure in the UK, costing the NHS ¬£2bn per year.

In finding the allegations proved, the committee said in knowingly allowing grades to be recorded when they were not based on completed and assessed work, she was ""dishonest when applying the standards of ordinary decent people"".""As an education professional she was required to maintain high professional and ethical standards,"" it said.""In particular, there is an expectation that registrants must strive to ensure the integrity of the assessment process.""Ms Griffith, said the panel, ""failed to conduct herself in a trustworthy manner and behaved in a way that lacked integrity and was dishonest"".""The committee concluded that the conduct found proved is fundamentally incompatible with Ms Griffith continuing to be a registered person,"" it said.No disciplinary action was taken as she resigned before allegations were fully investigated.The committee said her previous good record was taken into account but as she put her own interest before that of the students' and had not shown insight into the serious implications of her actions a prohibition order was the only appropriate sanction.Transgender care GP's fitness to practice impaired"
356,Brit Awards 2023 host Mo Gilligan gears up for show,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-64555077,"Glitz. Glamour. Criticism. It feels like no 2023 awards show is complete without some sort of row. But what do you do when you're the host?If you're Mo Gilligan, you don't get into it.Saturday's his second time fronting the Brits - and the show's been criticised because no women have been nominated for best artist.Mo tells BBC Newsbeat he thinks it's for the ""powers that be"" to decide who is nominated.""My job is to host the proceedings, as opposed to give my opinions.""I'm impartial,"" he says. It's also the second year for the best artist prize - the Brits replaced best male and best female awards with one, gender-neutral category in 2022.Mo's not unaware of the criticisms and Newsbeat aren't the only ones that've asked him about them. He also gave an interview to BBC music correspondent Mark Savage, and told him: ""No-one gets into this industry being like, 'I must win this award, I must be nominated for that'.""And the people that are watching it, the young kids who are like, 'Oh, I want to be like Adele or Beyonc√© , or, Sam Smith,' they just want to be like their idols.""This is a celebration of music first."" But the 34-year-old, who uses a lot of music in his routines, says he likes the fact artists are speaking out.""They're being heard and their opinions are being listened to,"" he tells Newsbeat.""It's nice to be part of musicians who are using their platform to have an opinion on society and life.""Criticism or not, it's fair to say there will be a lot of eyes on Mo when he hits the stage.And the comedian says he'd be lying if he said he wasn't nervous ahead of Saturday.""This is a big occasion for me and for so many people,"" Mo says.""I think it's nice to have some nerves you know, I think the day I don't have any nerves is the day that this is too normal.""And how will the chat show host, who has three Baftas to his name, calm those pre-show nerves?""Nothing that a little shot of tequila can't handle.""But what's he learnt from hosting the Brits for the first time in 2022?This video can not be playedMo Gilligan: Comedian returns to Brit School to inspire pupilsMo says he will ""probably be a bit calmer than last year"" when he was ""shouting a lot"".""I was just excited to be out in front of 20,000 people.

359,Sexual harassment: Victim sends message of support to other girls,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64595068,"A woman who was sexually harassed by her ice cream parlour boss as a teenager has urged other girls to report similar behaviour.Alona Forose was 15 in 2017 when she worked part-time in Scoopy Sweets and Ice Cream in Armagh. She has been awarded more than ¬£54,000 after the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier industrial tribunal's judgment. Ms Forose said Eugene Geraghty, who was then in his late 50s, inappropriately touched and smacked her. He was subsequently convicted of common assault and handed a risk of sexual harm order. Ms Forose said: ""I found Eugene Geraghty's behaviour dirty and distressing. When I challenged it, he just said I was lying. ""I'd like other girls to know that you don't have to put up with harassment, you can challenge it and you will be listened to.""Ms Forose had taken a sexual harassment and discrimination case to an industrial tribunal, which found in her favour.Mr Geraghty appealed the judgment, but the Court of Appeal upheld it and confirmed the awarding of ¬£54,335.84.The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, which supported Ms Forose, said her case should serve as a warning to employers that workers, no matter their age or employment status, should never be subjected to sexual harassment or discrimination. Chief Commissioner Geraldine McGahey described the award to Ms Forose as ""a substantial amount of money"". ""But the reality of it is no amount of money takes away the harm, the distress, the mental and physical anguish that this girl suffered,"" she told BBC News NI.""More importantly what it says is this kind of behaviour absolutely wrong. ""No one regardless of your age, let alone a school girl, should encounter such vile sexual harassment - whether that be the physical form or the verbal form, and it was both in Alona's case,"" she added."

362,Brit Awards 2023: Could Harry Styles sweep the board?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64585869,"Harry Styles could dominate the Brit Awards on Saturday night, with bookmakers predicting he'll win all four of the awards he's nominated for. The star is set to repeat his success from the Grammys, where the airbrushed pop LP Harry's House won best album.Styles is also up for best artist, best pop act and song of the year, for his ubiquitous smash hit, As It Was.He faces competition from Stormzy, Dua Lipa and indie duo Wet Leg when the ceremony kicks off at 20:30 GMT.It's the first time the event has been held on a Saturday night - with bosses hoping the new time slot will help boost audience figures, which fell to an historic low of 2.7 million people in 2022.In the 1990s, the Brits regularly attracted nine million viewers to its live shows, but audiences have been falling steadily for two decades.The 2023 instalment hopes to reverse the decline with performances from Lizzo, Sam Smith and Styles himself.Here's everything you need to know about the ceremony.The ceremony is broadcast live in the UK by ITV1 and ITVX from 20:30 - 22:45 GMT on Saturday 11 February.Outside the UK, viewers will be able to watch the ceremony on the official Brit Awards YouTube channel.And the BBC News website will have extensive coverage from the red carpet and the ceremony itself from 17:00 GMT.In 2022, the Brits merged separate male and female categories into new awards for ""best artist"" and ""best international artist"". But there was a backlash when women were excluded from this year's best artist shortlist, with high-profile acts like Charli XCX and Florence + The Machine failing to secure a nomination.""If the Brits are meant to be accolades for all, how can we persist with a category that this year has excluded half of the population?"" asked All Saints star Shaznay Lewis, herself a two-time Brit Award winner.Brits chairman Damian Christian called the situation ""disappointing"" - but noted that major acts like Adele and Dua Lipa hadn't released any music during the eligibility period.In fact, of the 70 acts put forward for best artist, only 12 were women, a figure that's illustrative of a wider problem: Only 20% of the artists signed to a major UK record label are female.""In 2022 there clearly wasn't enough women landing those big hits or albums,"" Christian told Music Week. ""And if this repeats itself this year and going forward, then we'll need to have discussions as an industry and hold ourselves accountable.""Harry Styles leads the performers' list, and he'll hoping to shake off the memory of last Sunday's Grammy performance, when his rotating stage malfunctioned, ruining three weeks of intricately-planned choreography.Sam Smith & Kim Petras will also be revisiting the Grammy performance of their hit single, Unholy. In the US, their erotically-charged set upset religious conservatives, who said the duo had embraced Satanic imagery. The Church of Satan, however, responded that the performance was ""alright"" and ""nothing particularly special"".Lizzo, Lewis Capaldi, Cat Burns, Wet Leg and Stormzy are also lined up to perform on Saturday, while DJ David Guetta will perform a set of hits, accompanied by Becky Hill and Ella Henderson.""The thing with the Brits is you never know what's going to happen,"" says comedian Mo Gilligan, who's back to host the show for a second time.""But I also get to see my friends, like Little Simz, pick up an award and take her mum on stage. It's a nice feeling to be part of that.""So how does he keep a poker face if one of his friends is beaten by Adele, George Ezra or Cat Burns?""I've got to be impartial!"" he protests. ""But if you want my opinions on music, we'll be here for a time. I listen to 80s groove and Motown, so I'm like, 'Where's Diana Ross? Get the Supremes in there!'""But at the same time, you want your friends to win, innit?""Isle of Wight indie duo Wet Leg, who formed on a whim at the top of a ferris wheel, are this year's most-nominated band, thanks to smart and salacious earworms like Chaise Longue and Angelica.They won two Grammys last weekend, for best alternative album and best alternative song (Chaise Longue again).""This is so funny,"" giggled singer Rhian Teasdale on stage in LA. ""What are we even doing here?""They should feel more comfortable on home soil, but the band say their four nominations were totally ""unexpected"".""We started out writing songs just to amuse ourselves,"" says Teasdale. ""If we could go back and visit our younger selves and say, 'This is where you'll be in 10 years' time,' I don't know what we'd do.""The Rising Star prize is the Brits' seal of approval for up-and-coming artists, previously won by Adele, Sam Fender, Jorja Smith and Rag N' Bone Man before they were famous.In recent years, the winner has been given a slot to perform alongside their heroes at London's O2 Arena. This year, they won't even be part of the televised ceremony - with their trophy handed over on the red carpet.That's a huge shame, as this year's winners, Flo, are one of the most exciting girl groups to come out of the UK in years. The trio, who also won the BBC Sound Of 2023, are incredible live performers. They could harmonise with a cement mixer and make it sound beautiful. Excluding them from the ceremony feels like a miss.Post-punk rock band Nova Twins are nominated in two categories on Saturday - best alternative act and best group.""It's amazing for us,"" says vocalist/guitarist Amy Love. ""When we were younger, we dreamt big. We were like, 'Yes, we can get to the Brit Awards.'""But then you start on your journey and reality sets in. Being women - and especially women of colour doing rock music - people were like, 'You should be doing hip-hop.'""So we had to navigate very differently, but now we're here.""The duo will be sticking to their DIY aesthetic by tailoring their own outfits for Saturday's red carpet.""We had to go big for the Brits,"" says bassist Georgia South. ""Our hint is, 'Regal punk fairies'.""""Hopefully it will stay intact,"" adds Love. ""We'll bring a needle and thread just in case anything pops off. No nipple slips.""Since 2011, the Brit Awards trophies have been re-designed by a different artist every year, with Dame Vivienne Westwood, Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Es Devlin all putting their unique spin on the statuette.London-based, Nigerian-born artist Slawn has created this year's prize, inspired by the bronze sculptures of his home country.The trophy has three separate faces, so that it looks different from every angle; while the iconic Britannia figure (a female personification of Britain) has removed her helmet.""The concept behind the sculpture is 'hats off to you',"" said Slawn. ""My decision to remove the helmet from the award is my way of thanking the Brits for providing me with this opportunity.""And who would he like to see picking up one of the trophies?""Taylor Swift,"" he said. ""And if not her, then Central Cee.""We Don't Talk About Bruno, a song from the animated film Encanto, is the first-ever Disney song to be nominated for a Brit Award.If it takes home the trophy for best international song, it'll also be the first Brit Award for Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the track.Elsewhere, Blackpink are the first ever K-pop girl group to receive a Brit nomination. They're shortlisted in the mind-bogglingly eclectic best international group category, alongside Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit, soul band Gabriels, Irish rock upstarts Fontaines DC and rap icons Drake & 21 Savage (for their collaborative album For Her).Earlier, this year, pop star Mimi Webb played a sneaky trick.After learning she'd been nominated for best new artist, she sat her mum down for a ""serious chat"".""Are you alright?"" asked Sue Webb, a look of concern flashing across her face, before Mimi broke the news.""Oh my God, I've got goosebumps,"" exclaimed Sue, blinking back tears.""She was so shocked!"" recalls Mimi, who's about to release her debut album, Amelia.""Even now, every day I get phone calls about it. She's just so excited.""Mrs Webb is accompanying her 22-year-old daughter to the show on Saturday‚Ä¶ but will Mimi mimic Little Simz and take mum on stage if she wins?""I'll definitely have to try,"" she laughs. ""But she might be a bit nervous.""Album of the Year is the night's main prize‚Ä¶ And Harry Styles looks like he's got it sewn up.His third solo record, Harry's House, is a big warm hug of an album inspired by 80s synth pop and 70s classic rock; that happens to contain the biggest single of 2022 - As It Was.The album sold 460,000 copies last year, more than four times as many as the next biggest-seller on the shortlist.That honour goes to Wet Leg's self-titled debut, which is full of angular, hook-laden student disco songs that tap into themes of millennial disaffection and anxiety.Stormzy gets his third album of the year nomination for This Is What I Mean, which delves deep into the artist's religious beliefs; while The 1975's Being Funny In A Foreign Language presents a more restrained version of a band known for their glitch-pop excess.The outlier is Fred Again's Actual Life Volume 3, a collection of emotive dance tracks that celebrate community and collaboration after the dark days of the lockdown.But let's face it, any outcome other than a Harry Styles victory would call the very existence of the Brit Awards into question.Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

363,Diabolical HMRC service hurts economy - accountants,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64599493,"Understaffing at HM Revenue & Customs is causing unacceptable delays and hindering economic activity, according to a leading accountants' group.The Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (ICAEW) said securing basic tax details takes months and is causing delays for companies.One accountant called the service ""diabolical"" and the institute wants an emergency taskforce drafted in. HMRC said it was responding to most correspondence within 15 days.It added that it was ""successfully answering about 70,000 calls a day"" and ""our customer satisfaction is consistently around 80%"".But Alan Pearce, a partner at leading tax adviser Blick Rothenberg, said: ""The level of service we are getting from HMRC is diabolical. ""The processing of information is too slow and that is holding up businesses being able to do their normal UK trade. It's unacceptable for taxpayers, companies, their agents and the economy as a whole."" Michael Izza, chief executive at the ICAEW, said: ""We're calling on ministers to set up an emergency taskforce to identify steps to eliminate HMRC's backlog and improve its service standards, so that in the future it supports, not inhibits, business growth and maximises the tax receipts needed to fund public services."" HMRC acknowledged there were problems, some of which derived from what it described as ""a significant attack from VAT registration fraudsters"" in July 2022.This led to new security measures that meant ""some genuine customers were caught in the new processes"".  But HMRC said that it had collected a record ¬£731bn in tax last year.  According to a Public Accounts Committee report, HMRC has reduced customer-facing staff from 25,500 to 19,500 over the past five years as it ""moved more customers to digital systems"".Mr Pearce said ""they have cut the numbers within HMRC quite drastically in the hope that the implementation of digitalisation would mean they would need fewer staff but the benefits of that have not materialised"".  The Public Accounts Committee said it had raised concerns with the tax office that reducing staff was premature and that they were cuts, not efficiency savings.HMRC told MPs that the Covid pandemic had caused a backlog. It said it saw ""further digital improvements as key to moving customers away from phone and post and making further efficiencies"".HMRC trials answer by text to cut call queuesBillions in Covid support lost to error and fraud"

The force said: ""We would like to stress that while this has been reported to us and we are making efforts to identify the owner at this time there is nothing to suggest this was anything other than one of many hundreds of vehicles in the area that morning.""Earlier, one of Ms Bulley's friends said the continuing search without any answers was ""almost like torture.Emma White had joined others in St Michael's on Wyre holding placards by the main road to jog people's memories.""We just need Nikki home for her two beautiful girls who want their mummy,"" she said.

""Often they are caught in desperate jeopardy, but equally we have a duty to house them appropriately and to work with local people.""The Home Office is trying very hard now to stop the excessive use of hotels and find different ways of placing them in appropriate places in the community and that is something the Home Office will achieve.""Lisa Nandy, Shadow Secretary of State for Communities, said the government was providing ""no support whatsoever"".""The government contracts big companies to provide what they call asylum support,"" she said. ""Instead these companies maximise the profit they make, they put people into some appalling accommodation without help or support - people who've been through hell and back before they even reached this country.""Sir George Howarth MP, Labour MP for Knowsley, said the protest was triggered by ""an alleged incident posted on social media"".Police confirmed they had been investigating reports that ""a man made inappropriate advances toward a teenage girl"" in Kirkby on Monday.No victim had been initially identified and a man in his 20s was arrested on Thursday in another part of the country on suspicion of a public order offence, Serena Kennedy, Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, said.He was released with no further action following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).The investigation was ""ongoing"" and Chief Constable Kennedy appealed for anyone with information to contact the police.Alan Marsden, who lives locally, said he attended the protest after seeing online accounts about the case involving the teenager but left when it became clear it was no longer peaceful.He said the protest initially involved ""mostly women and children"" but ""kids with masks and balaclavas"" later arrived. Merseyside Police said they had been ""facilitating a peaceful protest and counter protest"" outside the hotel but ""a number of people, who were not part of the original protest group, turned up, and it is clear that they were only interested in causing trouble"".Knowsley Council previously said it had been given less than 48 hours' notice in January 2022 of the Home Office's intention to temporarily accommodate asylum seekers at the hotel.Ms Nandy criticised the government for not consulting local communities hosting asylum seekers, saying: ""It is a recipe for disaster.""And when you lay on that you have a government that talks about things like an invasion in relation to immigration, you have a perfect storm, a really toxic mix that is being created.""We could change the rhetoric around asylum so that we no longer have a home secretary who tries to blame the government's failings on some of the most vulnerable people in our country.""Home Secretary Suella Braverman tweeted on Saturday that she condemned the ""appalling disorder"".""The alleged behaviour of some asylum seekers is never an excuse for violence and intimidation,"" she said.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

369,Turkey-Syria earthquake: UK aid appeal raises more than ¬£50m,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64609836,"A UK appeal to help earthquake survivors in Turkey and Syria has raised nearly ¬£53m in its first two days. The appeal by a collection of aid agencies was launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee and broadcast on television on Thursday evening.DEC said donations so far have reached ¬£52.8m. The total includes a contribution from the UK government, which had pledged to match the first ¬£5m raised.More than 24,000 people are now known to have died in the two earthquakes which struck southern Turkey and northern Syria in the early hours of Monday morning - with that number expected to rise still further.The British Red Cross, Oxfam and ActionAid are among the charities to have joined together to raise money for the many injured and homeless, whose lives have been devastated by the natural disaster.Thousands of buildings, including hospitals and schools, have collapsed and infrastructure in the region, including roads and energy supplies, has been badly damaged by the massive earthquakes. Buildings have also collapsed in north-west Syria - in an area which was already inhospitable and inaccessible after more than a decade of civil war, and where medical facilities are severely limited.  The DEC said it has used the money to continue its rescue efforts, with moments of miraculous rescues still emerging from the region. One of its charities, ActionAid, rescued a young girl from the rubble in north-west Syria after she was trapped for more than 36 hours. On being rescued, she asked to go home before remembering her home had been destroyed. Charity SEMA delivered 50 emergency shelter tents in Idlib, north-west Syria, and is providing hospital treatment to people injured in the earthquake. Its own staff are among the patients being treated in intensive care. DEC Chief Executive Saleh Saeed said: ""We're incredibly grateful to the British public for their hugely generous response to this horrific disaster. It's impossible not to see the images on TV and hear the stories coming from Turkey and Syria and not be moved. ""Compassion comes in many forms, but we are urging people to donate money rather than things.""The campaign to support the disaster-struck countries raised more than ¬£30m in its first 24 hours, with the King and Queen Consort thanked by the DEC for their ""generous donation"".The Scottish government is also contributing ¬£500,000.The DEC estimates there are 17 million people impacted by the disaster, many of them left without shelter in freezing winter conditions. It believes the recovery effort will take years.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak helped to pack the supplies at a donation centre supporting the appeal on Thursday evening.""As a dad, watching parents try and find their young children in the rubble, is heart-breaking,"" he said.""We will do everything that we can to help Turkey.""King thanked for 'generous' quake appeal donationEarthquake appeal by UK aid agencies raises ¬£32.9m"

371,Lady Jane Grey: Grant to preserve ruins of nine days' queen's home,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-64572986,"Plans to protect the ruins of the birthplace of England's nine days' queen Lady Jane Grey have been helped by a Historic England grant. The heritage watchdog has given ¬£37,160 to help assess the condition of Bradgate House, in Leicestershire.Much of the mansion, now within Bradgate Park, has fallen down but efforts are under way to preserve what still stands.The Bradgate Park Trust has welcomed the grant. The money will be used to examine the remnants of the 15th Century Grade II* listed scheduled monument and establish what repairs it requires.Lady Jane, a Protestant great-niece of Henry VIII, was born at Bradgate House in 1537 and became queen on 9 July 1553.She was deposed by her Catholic cousin Mary I nine days later and then executed, aged 17, in 1554.Park bosses said conserving the brick ruins, mostly low walls and foundations with some higher towers and a chapel, would prevent future deterioration and ensure visitors could safely tour the site.Part of the grant will also pay for an investigation of the chapel's original ceiling, which is currently obscured by a false ceiling and potentially hides a fine mural.Historic England's heritage at risk surveyor Amanda White said: ""Bradgate House is one of the earliest brick buildings in the country to have been built without defences. ""It was built on a grand scale and is an important medieval site, which demonstrates the wealth of those at the very highest level of late medieval society.  ""The house is today a ruinous complex with isolated structural concerns and broader repair needs.  Historic England is pleased to support the trust to better understand the repair needs of this fantastic site.""Bradgate Trust director James Dymond said: ""Bradgate House is a much-loved and iconic area for visitors to the park as it is home to so much important history. ""It's vital that it is conserved for future generations to admire, enjoy and study. ""The trust is delighted to receive this grant from Historic England as the first step to conserving the ruins and improving the future visitor experience there.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

372,RMT union rejects latest offers in rail dispute,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64600975,"The RMT union has rejected the rail industry's latest offers, dampening any hopes the lengthy dispute was close to its end.Network Rail and the train companies' group had called the proposals their ""best and final"".RMT boss Mick Lynch branded the offers ""dreadful"", while the transport secretary called the move ""a kick in the teeth for passengers"".The industry and government say members should be given a vote.The rejection was made by the national executive committee.  Twenty officials and representatives sit on the body but the RMT said the decision was made following a wide-ranging consultation with every level of the union involved in the national rail dispute.Mr Lynch said the offers did not meet members' expectations ""on pay, job security or working conditions"".The RMT said it would now seek further meetings with Network Rail and the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) - which represents train operating companies - to try to work towards a settlement.But it will start preparing to re-ballot its members when the existing strike mandate runs out in late May.It is a significant moment in the ongoing national rail dispute - not just because the RMT has rejected what were billed as final offers from the employers, but because the union is now talking explicitly about seeking an ""unconditional"" pay deal.  The government and industry have said all along that a pay increase would have to be funded by ""reforms"". There had been movement in the dispute in recent months and on all sides the tone had become less antagonistic. But it is clearly not as close to a resolution as some onlookers had hoped.The RDG said on Friday that passengers and ""many hard-working RMT members will be deeply dismayed that the union leadership has opted to reject our fair proposals without putting out a vote to their full membership in a democratic referendum"".It said it had made ""substantial changes"" to its offer after recent negotiations, including a minimum 9% pay increase over two years which rail workers ""will now miss out on, without even having had an opportunity to have their say"".""We removed driver-only operation and gave an improved job security offer,"" the group said, adding: ""The railway's financial crisis is not going away.""""The RMT leadership must now accept the urgent need to make the railway fit for the future for both our people, and the communities the railway serves,"" it said.Last month, the RDG put forward a list of changes to working practices which it said could fund a 5% pay rise for 2022 and a further 4% this year.Separately Network Rail, whose employees include maintenance and signalling staff, offered a package including a 5% pay increase last year and 4% for 2023, plus other benefits such as discounted travel for family. Members rejected this in December.Network Rail recently put forward a slightly updated offer, but kept the pay element the same.The RMT said it was seeking ""an unconditional pay offer, a job security agreement and no detrimental changes being imposed on members terms, conditions and working practices"".The transport secretary echoed the rail industry's position that RMT members should be given a vote on the deals on the table.Mark Harper said workers are ""being blocked from having a say on their own future"" and that a decision had been made for them behind closed doors.Planned changes to how maintenance teams at Network Rail work are a particular point of contention for the RMT.The union said it viewed proposed plans as ""unsafe"" and unworkable. Network Rail has always insisted safety would not be compromised.Mr Lynch said: ""We have carried out an in-depth consultation of our 40,000 members and the message we have received, loud and clear, is to reject these dreadful offers.""Our members cannot accept the ripping up of their terms and conditions or to have safety standards on the railway put into jeopardy under the guise of so-called modernisation.""If our union did accept these offers, we would see a severe reduction in scheduled maintenance tasks, making the railways less safe, the closure of all ticket offices, and thousands of jobs stripped out of the industry when the railways need more investment, not less.""Network Rail's chief negotiator Tim Shoveller claimed employees want to accept the offer and said the RMT ""is condemning its members to continuing a fruitless, pointless and costly dispute for everyone involved"".""Our rank-and-file employees are telling us they want to take the current improved offer that's on the table and to end this dispute but the RMT leadership refuses to listen and instead takes soundings from the echo chamber of its most active members,"" he said. This is separate to the train drivers' dispute. The drivers' main union, Aslef, says it hopes to have more talks next week.A smaller union, the TSSA, said on Friday that thousands of its members would be given a vote on the offers from the train companies."

The DUP has blocked the assembly's functioning for over a year in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements.Ex-health minister Robin Swann has said opt-out organ donation law in NI should not be part of a ""political stand-off"".Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member Paul Givan said his party would meet on Monday to ""take a position"" about electing a speaker.Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has said the organ donation law could be in place within days if the assembly was recalled.Mr Swann was the minister who introduced the Organ and Consent Bill - known as D√°ith√≠'s Law - in the assembly in 2021.It is named after six-year-old D√°ith√≠ Mac Gabhann from Belfast, who needs a heart transplant.Speaking to BBC News NI Ulster Unionist Party MLA Mr Swann said the delays to enacting the system were ""frustrating and disappointing"".""There shouldn't be a roadblock on this at this time,"" he said.The legislation would introduce an opt-out system, which would make everyone over 18 an organ donor unless they specifically state otherwise.The Department of Health said organ donations in relation to anyone under 18 will still require parental consent.It added that once the remaining bits of legislation are passed, a three-month lead-in time will be required to facilitate implementation planning and public awareness campaigns before the system goes live. D√°ith√≠'s parents have led a long-running campaign for the law to be finalised and enacted but is being held up by the political crisis at Stormont.Mr Swann said D√°ith√≠'s parents should not have to deal with that when they were trying to prioritise their son's health.""It's heart-wrenching and a hard enough emotional point for them to be dealing with, without getting caught up in the politics of this,"" the UUP politician said.Speaking on Friday, D√°ith√≠'s father M√°irt√≠n Mac Gabhann said he would put pressure on politicians to finally approve the organ donation law.""I have no loyalties to any of the political parties - my loyalty is to D√°ith√≠,"" he said.D√°ith√≠'s Law was passed in the assembly in February 2022 but additional legislation is needed to specify which organs and tissues are covered under the opt-out system.Without that the system cannot come into effect.Mr Mac Gabhann said he had ""a bit more faith"" that the legislation could finally be approved by Stormont assembly members.""There's nothing more important to me than D√°ith√≠'s Law in the political world,"" he told BBC News NI on Friday.""If this is a possibility through the assembly or whether it's Westminster we will look at all avenues and we will put pressure on all the parties.""He said he was due to speak to Mr Givan of the DUP on Friday.D√°ith√≠ and his parents travelled to England this week for the boy to have a cardiac procedure at a hospital in Newcastle.Sitting up and ready to #FIGHT!Last week Mr Heaton-Harris said a proposal to take the legislation through Westminster instead of Stormont would take too long to complete.On Thursday he wrote to the political parties to say that if they returned to Stormont they could have ""this legislation in place in a matter of days"".""This would be the quickest, most straightforward path to progressing this important legislation that D√°ith√≠ and his family have campaigned so tirelessly for,"" he told the parties in a letter seen by BBC News NI.But DUP MP Ian Paisley accused him of ""political blackmail"" and said Mr Heaton-Harris had the power to pass D√°ith√≠'s Law ""within a stroke of his pen"".""The government should take a very hard stand and say we are in charge, the Northern Ireland Office are in charge,"" said the North Antrim MP on Friday.""They can enact this though the House of Commons immediately and it will be a far faster process than the assembly getting back up and running.""Mr Swann has written to the top civil servant at the Department of Health to ask if it has taken necessary steps around procedural legislation to ensure it can be passed by MLAs if an assembly recall goes ahead next week.It follows a letter from outgoing assembly Speaker Alex Maskey on Friday, who said it was ""theoretically possible"" to pass the legislation in one sitting next week as long as the Department of Health had already laid technical regulations.NI secretary increases pressure to pass organ lawTransplant boy's family consider legal actionNI organ donation change bill passes Assembly vote"

377,Stained glass breathes new life into derelict buildings,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64596733,"For the past three years Christina Dembinska has been breathing new life into forgotten buildings with her handmade stained glass window installations.The history behind lonely, abandoned structures fuels her passion for giving them a second chance and wowing passers-by. Christina, 63, started the guerrilla art project while studying for an MA in Glass in 2020, before turning her focus to where best to display her masterpieces.''I loved making stained glass windows, but where was I going to put them?"" she said.''And then I had this idea of fitting them into derelict buildings. I was really curious about the history behind them.''Christina, who lives and works in London, has always been captivated by Wales. Her grandmother was originally from Monmouth and her grandfather from Holyhead on Anglesey.""As soon as I arrive and I see the hills, something happens,'' she said.''In Wales there are a lot of derelict structures, and I am drawn to wondering who lived there and what went on there.''The first of her installations were fitted in two old farm buildings on the border of the Hafod Estate in Ceredigion.She hopes her work can go some way to helping preserve historical buildings.''It's only a small thing, a stained glass window. But maybe having it there somehow sparks it back into life,'' she said.''It's such a beautiful medium. As soon as the light comes through, it just sings.''''By bringing attention to the building, it could spark someone's curiosity and maybe they will then look into the history of that site.''Research is important to her creative process, wanting to ensure the window is relevant to its location.''I often put song lyrics or words into them. I can engrave things into the glass that is related to the community or that tells a story of the building.''Most of her glass artwork is placed in remote locations and in structures varying from crumbling quarries to deserted farm buildings.It means some of her art could go unnoticed by most, but Christina believes that's part of the magic.''I like hearing that someone has come across one of the windows by chance. The more remote they are you do start to wonder whether anybody will see them'' she said.''But I think, interestingly, people do. You don't realise how many people are wandering around in remote places.''Sadly, as was the case with her installation at Dinorwic Quarry, near Llanberis, Gwynedd, some of her pieces do end up broken or destroyed.''The first time it happened I was a bit upset,'' she said. ''But then I thought, actually, when it's there you can't protect it anymore. It's almost become part of the project.''There is something about the fragility of it. The glass is like the building, both can be broken.''However, the majority of her work has been received positively.In some cases she has even formed connections with people from the local communities.''Once, I wrote a letter to a man who owned one of the buildings I'd put a window into. He actually wrote back and shared the history of it with me.''He'd inherited the place from his grandfather, who was a miner, and they used to farm the land together.''He couldn't come and see it any more because he's elderly and it was on top of a very steep hill, but it brought back all these memories for him.''A lot of things have happened like that which have been really lovely, a consequence of the art.''One of her larger installations was at the ruins of a chapel, built in the 1870s, in a slate valley near Machynlleth, Powys.After coming across the building, she wandered over to one of the few neighbouring houses.The couple who lived there, Sarah Samson and Steve Watkins, told her about the work they had done clearing the chapel for its 150th anniversary and their hopes of restoring it.They helped Christina fit the windows, eager to bring it back into the community.Sarah said: ''There is so much heritage in Wales. It needs everybody to look at it and ask what are we going to do with it that is relevant?'''Work like Christina's says somebody cares, somebody wants this place to be noticed.''Since the clearing of the chapel, the people of the valley now come together once a year to celebrate Christmas there.Dr Mark Baker is an architectural historian from Conwy who has also founded the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, which in 2018 bought the Grade I-listed Gwrych Castle, near Abergele, Conwy. ''It was a desire, on my part, to give something back to my community by trying to restore somewhere,'' he said.''We've had I'm a Celebrity at the castle now and it's been featured all over the world. All of this brings people to north Wales and the local area.''He said Welsh government involvement should go further to preserve historical buildings.''There's a whole raft of properties that are at risk and I think there should be a review of how these are protected.''In Wales, the system doesn't always work because lots of the local authorities push culture and conservation down the agenda due to funding.''So, historic buildings and their preservation are often the first things that get cut.''The Welsh government said it recognises the ""positive action communities can take to protect and preserve what matters to them"".''This activity is supported by Cadw through its capital grant programme and the grant aid it gives to organisations, such as the Architectural Heritage Fund.""Christina believes art is one way communities can help save historical structures in Wales.''I think one of the functions of art is to make you think or draw attention to something and look at things in a different way.''That can be enough to spark your curiosity and think about these buildings.''The 15-year-old selling her artwork for ¬£23kVandals smash church's 'beautiful' windowsThe man teaching Ant and Dec to speak WelshSeven reasons Wales has a new World Heritage Site"

380,Epsom College: Gun law plea renewed after family found dead,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-64609602,"A woman fighting for changes to UK gun laws after her sister and nieces were shot dead has demanded immediate action after the Epsom College tragedy.Emma Ambler's sister Kelly Fitzgibbons and her two daughters were killed in Sussex in 2020 by partner Robert Needham who then killed himself.She spoke out after Epsom College head Emma Pattison was found dead with her daughter and husband on Sunday.The Home Office said the UK had some of the strictest controls in the world.George Pattison, 39, is thought to have shot his 45-year-old wife and their daughter Lettie, aged seven, before killing himself.The accountant's legally-owned gun was found at their home in the school grounds.The watchdog is not investigating police contact with Mr Pattison over his firearms licence.Mrs Ambler is campaigning for much stricter controls on licences, however, including annual reviews of firearms licence-holders. Currently the law states reviews must take place every five years. Although few details have emerged about the Pattisons' deaths, the tragedy has caused very painful reminders for the family of Ms Fitzgibbons.After she and her daughters were killed in Woodmancote, an inquest found Mr Needham was awarded a licence even though police found he lied on his application about periods of depression and a police caution he received as a youth.Mrs Ambler, of Birmingham, has called for changes she said were ""very easy and could be made with immediate effect"".She said: ""They are to not grant gun licences to people who are found to be lying as part of the application process, as Rob did, and don't give gun licences to people with mental health issues or re-occurring episodes of depression, as Rob had.""At my sister's inquest three separate police officers said reviews should be held annually, yet they aren't because they aren't resourced to do so.""She said a Home Office meeting had been delayed, adding: ""If we keep waiting another family will lose their lives, and very tragically that has happened in Surrey.""A Home Office spokesman said a review followed shootings in Plymouth in 2021 when Jake Davison, 22, shot and killed five people and injured two others before he shot himself. He said: ""Police forces in England, Scotland and Wales were asked to urgently review their firearms licensing practices, confirming that forces were adhering to the guidance for issuing and reviewing them.""A meeting date with the Kelly Fitzgibbons Foundation would be finalised, he added.Inquests into the deaths in Plymouth are ongoing and Mr Davison's is still to be held.Gun victim's twin to meet ministers in law change bidNo probe into police contact with Epsom head husbandTougher gun checks 'could have prevented' killingsTwin's gun law anger after family shooting deathsCoroner services"

An investigation by BBC Newsnight and BBC West Midlands found a lack of communication had led to some haematology patients dying without receiving treatment.In December 2022, Newsnight heard allegations whistle blowers were punished by management for raising safety worries.Tristan Reuser, an eye surgeon at UHB told the programme: ""If senior management can't run a hospital properly and don't want to listen to feedback, criticism, about patient safety issues, then who suffers in the end, it's the patients.""Months earlier, in July 2022, it has emerged the PHSO took the unusual step of issuing what is known as an Emerging Concerns Protocol, to alert NHS England to its own concerns about the trust.The PHSO said its investigations had uncovered ""serious concerns"" about UHB.It said: ""These include the culture of the Trust, its failure to fully accept or acknowledge the impact of our findings from investigations on patient safety, and its approach to the duty of care to its staff.""Ombudsman Rob Behrens added: ""There needs to be significant improvements in culture and leadership so that people living in the West Midlands can access high quality and safe hospital care with confidence.""NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board announced in December there would be three reviews to address the allegations made by BBC Newsnight and wider issues of leadership and culture.The first began in December and is focussing specifically on the Newsnight allegations, overseen by a ""senior independent clinician from outside the local health system"".The trust also commissioned a broader external review of culture at UHB.The third review will be external, carried out in partnership with NHS England and NHS Birmingham and Solihull.The ombudsman has said it wanted to have a say in that third inquiry, which it said ""would have benefited from the contributions we offered to make"".

He was 11 years old at the time and a pupil at Abertillery Learning Community in Blaenau Gwent.In a statement, Ms Bailey said: ""I am overwhelmingly disappointed by the police's decision to take no further action in Raheem's case.""Although the police had indicated to me that this was the likely outcome, I feel that their statement makes it clear that they have taken at face value all other versions of events other than Raheem's. ""Yet he is the victim in this and has been left with a life-changing injury. ""My son is still traumatised by what happened to him and has a permanent physical reminder of the torment he suffered that day. ""The events of that day followed a sustained campaign of bullying at the school over the preceding months and a previous experience that had taught him that reporting to a teacher would not make a difference. ""To state that no others were involved in what happened to Raheem is a complete insult and the police's point about him leaving the school of his own accord is irrelevant.""She added that there had been no dispute he left of his own accord, but he did so ""in a state of sheer panic and despair, which left him feeling as if he had no option other than to leave the school ground by any means necessary"". She added: ""It is the altercation that caused him to flee the school in terror, and how he was allowed to do so unchecked and unchallenged by any responsible adult, that needs to be addressed.""Raheem's family is considering taking civil legal action against the school, for ""negligence"" due to ongoing bullying and lack of supervision on the day of the incident.Blaenau Gwent council said it is launching an inquiry into the incident and has been contacted for a response.While she welcomed the inquiry, she said she was ""disgusted"" the school had not informed her directly and she only learned about it in the press.The family's solicitor, Frances Swaine from law firm Leigh Day, added: ""We echo our client's disappointment, not only with the conclusion arrived at by the police but by the way they have chosen to communicate this, which seems to lay any blame with Raheem and exonerate all others. ""The altercation that led to him leaving school should be re-examined. ""Raheem had been reporting the bullying he had suffered for months but he felt that nothing was done by the school to help him.  ""We will be supporting Shantal in making a complaint to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) regarding the police's handling of this incident and we are also investigating a civil legal claim against Abertillery Learning Community for negligence."" On Friday Gwent Police said: ""Officers have interviewed several people under caution and viewed CCTV footage from the school.""Our investigation found that Raheem left the school premises of his own accord, and no other persons were involved in him sustaining the injury to his hand.""After undertaking a detailed and thorough investigation we will not be taking any further action.""Blaenau Gwent council said on Friday its thoughts were with Raheem and his family and it was commissioning an independent review to identify any lessons to improve the response to future incidents.It' added: ""First and foremost, a young person has suffered a life-changing injury, and our thoughts remain with the learner and his family,"" a council statement read.""This has been an extremely difficult time for all involved.

384,Onshore wind: 'I've saved ¬£200 because of my local turbine',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64264643,"This video can not be playedWATCH: ""Proud to be a Nimby"": Mike Padgett says energy bill discounts for living near a turbine are a bribe, but others disagreeFor more than seven years there has been an effective ban on new onshore wind developments in England after a planning clampdown. Now, with the rules set to be relaxed, the government is considering offering people who want to host turbines in their area money off their energy bills in return. The rolling hills around the rural town of Market Weighton, in East Yorkshire, are dotted with wind turbines. From his garden, Ellis Jacklin, who lives on the outskirts of the town, can see several in the distance. There are 226 turbines across the East Riding of Yorkshire - the highest number of any area in England, according to trade body RenewableUK. But while new onshore wind developments have provoked vocal opposition from some locals in the past, Ellis supports more being built. The 29-year-old has seen first-hand the potential benefits of this relatively cheap source of renewable energy. He's part of a scheme run by energy supplier Octopus which offers discounts to customers in three areas with turbines nearby, including Market Weighton.The government is looking at whether the idea could be rolled out more widely so people who are happy to have turbines where they live can benefit directly.Customers signed up to the Octopus scheme get 20% off their electricity bill when their local turbine is spinning and a 50% discount when it's particularly windy.  Since January last year Ellis, who works as a project engineer, has saved around ¬£200 through the initiative. With the country in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, driven in part by soaring energy costs, Ellis says the savings have made a big difference. ""It's helping the environment, we're also in addition to that saving a bit of money,"" he says. ""It's a no brainer."" Octopus says on average customers have saved more than ¬£100 a year through the scheme, depending on their energy usage, but some have saved as much as ¬£400. A government survey last year suggested around 78% of people are supportive of onshore wind but a smaller proportion - 43% - said they would be happy to have a wind farm in their local area. Ellis believes offering energy bill discounts could persuade more people to back new turbines being built in their own community.  ""There's a massive push on renewable energy,"" he says. ""And I think when somebody can directly relate it to their bills and say, there's a wind turbine spinning near me and when that's moving I get money off, I think it really brings it home."" However, Sarah McMonagle, from CPRE, the Countryside Charity, has concerns about the idea, saying developments which have community support ""don't need bribes"". Ms McMonagle says her charity supports moving away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible but it thinks the focus should be on offshore wind and rooftop solar, which she says are more popular forms of renewable energy than onshore turbines. ""New onshore [wind] needs to be brought forward in collaboration with the local community and it needs to be sensitive to landscapes,"" she adds. Zoisa North-Bond, chief executive of Octopus's energy generation division, stresses the company only supports building turbines where people want them. She says the idea of offering money off bills for communities who live near turbines has been popular. As well as Market Weighton, the company also offers the discounts to customers in Caerphilly, south Wales, and Halifax, West Yorkshire, and the scheme is oversubscribed in all three areas.  At the moment, it's relatively small scale, with about 2,800 households signed up. However, Octopus has plans to expand the initiative and is hoping to have at least 1,000 turbines across the UK by the end of the decade. There are some barriers though - Ms North-Bond says it can take years to connect a turbine to the electricity grid, while the current planning rules in England make it very difficult for new onshore wind farms to be built. In 2015 the government introduced stricter requirements, with companies only allowed to apply to build turbines on land specifically identified for development in plans drawn up by local councils. Proposals also needed the backing of local communities.The changes saw a sharp decline in the number of planning applications being submitted.  In December the government promised to relax some of these restrictions, including the requirement for new turbines to be built on pre-designated land, although projects would still need local support. A consultation, which is due to last until April, is currently looking at how local opinion can be determined. It's also seeking views on how communities who want to host turbines can benefit directly.The idea of offering discounts to people who are willing to live near turbines already has the support of some Conservative MPs. In a recent report a group of Tory backbenchers argued this could provide an incentive for people to host renewable projects. Under the report's proposals, new onshore wind developments would be subject to a local referendum.It suggests a 100% discount on energy bills for those living within one mile of a proposed site for the lifetime of the project, with smaller discounts of 50% for those within three miles and 25% for those within four miles. The group argues this would encourage developers to avoid sites close to built-up areas, minimising the disruption and visual impact on residents. Former Business Secretary Dame Andrea Leadsom, who chairs the committee which wrote the report, is planning to meet government ministers to discuss the proposals. She believes they could have broad appeal, even amongst Tory MPs who have been concerned about the impact of wind farms in their constituency. ""In recent years, we've seen a lot of people become far keener on seeing much more renewable energy in their area,"" she says, adding that the ""rocketing"" cost of energy and a desire to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels are both playing a part in shifting views. But back in East Yorkshire, not everyone is convinced. Mike Padgett lives down the road from Market Weighton in the village of Sancton on the edge of the Yorkshire Wolds, an area popular with walkers. There are 11 turbines around a mile from his house and he's previously been involved in local campaigns against more being built. ""There are lots of footpaths around our village and some of these turbines were almost 20 yards away from the footpath,"" he says. ""They are a massive industrial blot on the landscape in the wrong areas. And in a little place like ours, we just felt that it was just not the right place.""Mike, 70, is worried proposals to ease planning restrictions for onshore wind will mean more turbines are approved - even if there's opposition from some of those living closest to them. He says getting money off his bills would ""help soften the impact"" of the turbines which are already there and could be a fair way of compensating local people. But he's wary about the idea of developers using discounts to persuade people - and it wouldn't persuade him to support more turbines being built. ""If I could get rid of coal and oil and gas tomorrow I would,"" he says. ""But not at the expense of having turbines all around us.""Video production and additional reporting by Thomas MasonOnshore wind rules to be relaxed after Tory revoltWind generated a record amount of power in 2022"

However rescuers, including firefighters from South Wales and Mid and West Wales fire services, are still finding survivors buried in the rubble - five days since the earthquake struck.The carnage unfolded when a 7.8 magnitude quake struck near Gaziantep and was followed by multiple aftershocks. One, almost as large as the first, measured 7.5 magnitude.Busra, who was born in Besni and brought up in Swindon, travelled on Monday to Turkey to help. Mr Thomas, from Bridgend, said: ""On Tuesday there were signs of life, they think they heard their grandmother because there were noises coming from the building.""They were able to speak to the aunt on Wednesday. Then everything went quiet.""The 24-year-old said signs of life had been detected with heat-sensitive cameras.A lack of machinery meant people were digging through rubble by hand.

391,Ancient stone tools found in Kenya made by early humans,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64595418,"Archaeologists in Kenya have dug up some of the oldest stone tools ever used by ancient humans, dating back around 2.9 million years.It is evidence that the tools were used by other branches of early humans, not just the ancestors of Homo Sapiens.The tools were used to butcher hippos and pound plant materials like tubers and fruit, the researchers said.Two big fossil teeth found at the site belong to an extinct human cousin, known as Paranthropus.Scientists had previously thought that Oldowan tools, a kind of simple stone implement, were only used by ancestors of Homo Sapiens, a grouping that includes our species and our closest relatives.However, no Homo Sapien fossils were found at the excavation site in Nyayanga on the Homa Peninsula in western Kenya. Instead, there were two teeth - stout molars - from the Paranthropus genus that had combined ape-like and human-like traits, along with 330 stone tools.""With these tools you can crush better than an elephant's molar can and cut better than a lion's canine can,"" said Prof Rick Potts, of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, a senior author of the study.""Oldowan technology was like suddenly evolving a brand new set of teeth outside your body, and it opened up a new variety of foods on the African savannah to our ancestors.""""The association of these Nyayanga tools with Paranthropus may reopen the case as to who made the oldest Oldowan tools. Perhaps not only Homo, but other kinds of hominins were processing food with Oldowan technology,"" said anthropologist Thomas Plummer of Queens College in New York City, lead author of the research published in the journal Science.The latest find of the Oldowan tools show that they were a significant upgrade in sophistication compared to earlier crude stone tools dated to as early as 3.3 million years old, before the emergence of the Homo genus, researchers said.Other hominins existing at the time included the genus Australopithecus, known for the famous even-older fossil ""Lucy"" which was found in 1974 in northern Ethiopia."
392,Israel legalises nine West Bank settlement outposts,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64620734,"The Israeli government has authorised nine Jewish settlements in the West Bank which were previously unauthorised outposts.It is the first such move by the new government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The international community regards all settlements as illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.Palestinians see settlements as a major obstacle to a peace deal with Israel.They want all settlements and outposts to be removed from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which they seek for a future Palestinian state.Israel has built about 140 settlements housing some 600,000 Jews since it occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.Also on Sunday, Israeli authorities announced mass construction of new homes within established settlements.A statement from Mr Netanyahu's office said a planning committee would convene in the coming days to approve new settlement homes. The far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Twitter these would number 10,000.According to national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, the steps have been taken now in response to two recent attacks by Palestinians which killed 10 Israelis in occupied East Jerusalem.The latest, on Friday, claimed the lives of two brothers aged six and eight, and a 20-year-old man.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's administration said Sunday's announcement should be ""condemned and rejected"".There has been no immediate comment from the US, but ambassador Thomas Nides previously made clear Washington would oppose such moves.""We want to keep a vision of a two-state solution alive.

393,Crisis upon crisis: Why it's hard to get help to Syria after earthquake,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64600913,"A crisis within a crisis within a crisis - such is the blighted landscape of Syria, now reeling in the wake of a crushing earthquake and a decade and more of debilitating war.The country's seismic shock hasn't broken entrenched conflicts and obstacles which have always obstructed urgent humanitarian action in a country ravaged by war. But four days after a deadly earthquake struck, there's a small crack which may widen the spaces for urgent humanitarian action. ""It's a good step forward but many more are needed,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, told the BBC after Syrian state media reported that the Syrian cabinet had given the go-ahead for the delivery of humanitarian aid to all parts of the country. According to the Sana News Agency, that would include both state-controlled areas as well as those controlled by other groups.The relief effort would be co-ordinated with the United Nations, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross, it said. But the news is also being treated cautiously.  Mr Griffiths stressed the announcement only meant aid could be delivered across Syria's internal front lines - not across the border from neighbouring countries. ""We are also urgently seeking approval for additional crossing points to meet the life-saving needs of the people."" At present, there is only approved route into the north-western Syrian province of Idlib, the last rebel-held enclave: through the Bab al-Hawa crossing over the Turkish border. Vital lifelines like this have to be authorised by the UN Security Council. Russia as well as China have repeatedly used their veto to support the Syrian government's rock-hard rule that mechanisms like this violate its sovereignty. The UN, among others, has repeatedly urged Syria and its allies to allow aid to flow into northern Syria from another route via Bab al-Salameh on the Turkish border, as well as a crossing from Iraq into the largely Kurdish areas of north-eastern Syria.This week, Syrian opposition groups announced that they had secured Ankara's approval, for the first time in years, to use corridors at Bab al-Salameh as well as another at al-Rai. Unlike the UN, other non-governmental aid agencies don't require UN Security Council approval.This video can not be playedWatch: How rescuers' videos give glimpse into Syria quake horrorOn Thursday, when the first UN relief convoy carrying blankets and other supplies finally rumbled through Bab al-Hawa, the reaction was bittersweet. It was aid that was scheduled to come before the earthquake struck, lamented Syrian journalist Ibrahim Zeidan, who spoke to us from a town near the border crossing. This route, badly damaged in Monday's tremors, has long been the only source of sustenance for more than four million Syrians, most of whom rely on handouts to survive.Most were displaced time and again, from one province to the next, in the early years of this conflict. Now people living with almost nothing have lost even that.  ""The most earthquake-stricken area of Syria is in the north-west,"" underlined Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council. ""We need full and free access across front lines, and full and free distribution."" Aid sources point out that in the past, some humanitarian aid reaching opposition-held areas through government-controlled provinces was rejected. There's also been a concern that aid could be diverted on the way.  ""We hope both the armed opposition and the government will put aside politics,"" Mr Egeland emphasised to the BBC, adding that what was really needed now was a humanitarian ceasefire.  He also expressed caution over the Syrian government's apparent concession, saying similar statements had been made before - but not followed through. The UN is now under mounting pressure to find new ways to override politics and establish new routes as concern mounts over the depth of suffering, as millions shelter in tents or on open ground in freezing winter temperatures.  This weekend, Mr Griffiths will travel to both Syria and Turkey ""to show solidarity with the people of both countries"".But in Damascus, sovereignty will also be on the agenda again especially since Syrian government-controlled areas like the northern city of Aleppo were also hit by tremors - which don't take sides in this conflict. Syrians, wherever they live, have been pulled down by years of grinding poverty and multiple privations.  ""Why don't [Western nations] treat countries the same way?"" Dr Bouthaina Shaaban, special adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, demanded on the BBC's Newshour programme this week. ""It's not humanity, it's politics,"" she declared, as she called on Western countries to lift sanctions she said were stopping Syrians abroad from rallying to help.  Washington has issued a license to allow sanctions relief for earthquake-stricken Syria. But its verbal barbs were as sharp as those coming from Damascus. ""This is a regime that has never shown any inclination to put the welfare, the well-being, the interests of its people first,"" said state department spokesman Ned Price.  Aid has always been weaponised in Syria. During our regular reporting from Syria during the most ferocious years of fighting, we saw close up how a merciless ""surrender or starve"" tactic was repeatedly wielded, mainly by government forces as they cut off entire communities seen as supporting their rivals.  Syrian officials emphasise that aid must be channelled through them, not organisations like the White Helmets.The volunteer teams trained on pulling survivors from the rubble of Syrian or Russian air strikes have now been rescuing people from the ruins in Idlib. Much of north-western Syria is under the sway of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist movement designated as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and Washington, which tries to distance itself from past links to al-Qaeda.  Syria's political map is a minefield for humanitarian work. In the north-west of Syria, it's Syrian Kurdish forces which control large swathes of territory, mainly in opposition to Damascus, but occasionally striking alliances of convenience. Pockets controlled by Islamic State forces further compound the risks embedded in any relief operation.  Earthquake aid is also reflecting a new regional political map emerging in recent years, as some Arab states - who once worked closely with Western capitals to support the Syrian opposition - have taken a different tack.The United Arab Emirates, the first among Gulf Arab states to try to draw Damascus back into the Arab fold, partly to try to pull it from its close links to Iran, was quick to establish a humanitarian air bridge to both Syria and Turkey. Saudi Arabia has done the same, with other Arab states providing aid to either Syria or Turkey, or both.  In recent months, before this latest crisis, there were also signs of a cautious rapprochement between Damascus and Ankara, which have been at daggers drawn throughout Syria's long war. In December, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, partly nudged by Russia, spoke of ""pouring oil on troubled waters"". But the presence of Turkish troops in northern Syria is a major irritant. For President Erdogan, they've been a bulwark against the advance of the Syrian military in the north-east, and Syrian Kurdish forces in the north-west seen as linked to his sworn enemy, the PKK.  Syria, like a territorial version of Russia's traditional nesting dolls, is many wars in one. Turkey, the US, Russia, and Iran all have forces somewhere on the ground, and Israeli warplanes are often in the air against suspected Iranian or Lebanese Hezbollah targets. Aid should not go through ""any of the political actors in Syria, neither in the government-controlled nor in the opposition-controlled areas,"" said Mr Egeland. His call to ""put people first"" is being desperately echoed in areas now levelled by nature's force.Inside Aleppo: BBC sees devastation after quakeFirst aid convoy since quake reaches northern SyriaSyria doctor: ‚ÄòWhen he looked at me, I started crying‚Äô"
394,Eskom crisis: What does South Africa‚Äôs state of disaster mean?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64594499,"South Africa's president has declared a state of disaster to try and deal with a crippling and unprecedented energy crisis. South Africans have been facing blackouts every day, which have badly affected homes and businesses, but what difference will this emergency measure make, if any?At an ice cream parlour in Soweto, one company has been struggling to keep their frozen treats cold amid rolling power-cuts, referred to locally as ""load shedding"".""It's terrible,"" Thando Makhubu, owner of Soweto Creamery, told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""When load-shedding is really, really bad, we find ourselves using our profit to run,"" Mr Makhubu said.He even fears customers might stop coming to his creamery: ""We have had customers who assume that we are closed, because of load-shedding, so I am really worried that if load-shedding worsens, people won't come.""His is just one of many businesses and households that have been affected by South Africa's energy shortage, which has even led to protests, with people declaring that ""enough is enough"".So the pressure has been mounting on President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the issue, which he said he would confront head-on: ""We must act to lessen the impact of the crisis on farmers, on small businesses, on our water infrastructure, on our transport network and a number of other areas and facilities that support our people's lives,"" he said in his state of the nation address on Thursday.Before a clapping crowd, he announced: ""We are therefore declaring a national state of disaster to respond to the electricity crisis and its effect.""President Ramaphosa outlined that the escalation of the crisis would allow the government to implement ""practical measures that we need to take to support businesses,"" he said, highlighting those in food production and retail supply chains.""It will also enable us to exempt critical infrastructure such as hospitals and water treatment plants from load-shedding,"" he said, adding that it would allow the government to remove red tape for energy projects and so build them faster.This crisis is nothing new, and has been 15 years in the making. The country's state-owned power company, Eskom, has $26bn (¬£21bn) of debt, old infrastructure, power stations that do not work properly, not to mention a recent strike which crippled the company.However, the power shortage has escalated in recent months, with South Africans facing electricity cuts for 288 days last year, while this year there have been electricity blackouts for up to 15 hours a day.A state of disaster effectively means that the government is given additional powers to resolve a crisis with less bureaucracy, regulation and extra funds.However, further details of what will change have not been made public, with one analyst, Ted Blom, telling the AFP news agency that ""we don't know what the government actually plans to do"".A state of disaster was also implemented during the covid pandemic, and saw some people abusing the emergency measure.In 2020, the country's then-auditor general said he uncovered ""frightening findings"" of overfunding and potential fraud in the use of the Covid-19 relief fund, including some cases where personal protective equipment (PPE) was bought for five times more than the price the national treasury had advised. The government reacted by telling those accused of corruption to resign and cooperate with law enforcement.However, the president anticipated potential corruption, and said measures will be put in place to prevent this. But despite his attempts to address potential corruption, concerns still persist, with the chief whip of the opposition Democratic Alliance, telling the BBC that her party would be ""challenging this declaration"" because there should be ""targeted"" intervention towards Eskom instead of a general state of disaster.""[It] gives unfettered powers to the executive, the parliament has no oversight over the executive under some of those sections of the act,"" Siviwe Gwarube also told South Africa's News24. ""And also more importantly, it allows government departments across the board to essentially subvert procurement processes as and when at will,"" she added.There are also those who think the emergency measure will make no difference at all, and that the president hasn't taken decisive enough action.""What the country needs at this time was a deliberate and very decisive action plan with timelines, with targets and with a progress report,"" Dr Nthabiseng Moleko, a development economist from Stellenbosch Business School, told South Africa's SABC news channel. ""It doesn't look like these solutions that we have are going to yield any outcome that is going to change the course and the path that this country is on,"" she added.The appointment of a minister of electricity was also announced under the purview of assuming ""full responsibility for overseeing all aspects of the electricity crisis response"".However, this new position has been mocked online, with some saying they would be clueless about how to solve the crisis and saying the country could soon end up with a minister of ""potholes"".The president also outlined plans for the country to continue with its green energy transition programme, including through the ""roll-out of rooftop solar panels"".South Africa relies on aging coal-fired power stations for most of its electricity - in 2020, just 7% of its energy came from renewable sources, according to the International Energy Agency.

395,Turkey-Syria earthquake: footballer Priscilla Okyere gives eyewitness account,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/africa/64591864,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section Sport AfricaGhana midfielder Priscilla Okyere is terrified of going to sleep, afraid that another earthquake might happen when she is in bed. The 27-year-old plays for Hatayspor in southern Turkey, and is a survivor of the devastating quake that struck there on Monday.The earthquake is already considered the worst worldwide in a decade. So far it is known to have killed over 20,000 people in Turkey and Syria - a toll that will certainly rise.Hatayspor is the club whose men's team Okyere's compatriot Christian Atsu plays for. Atsu, along with the club's sporting director Taner Savut, remains missing.‚ÄúI have not been sleeping for four days - I'm so scared to go to sleep,‚Äù Okyere told BBC Sport Africa.‚ÄúEven today, we had a safe place to sleep. I haven't closed my eyes from 5am til now.‚ÄúWhen someone bangs the door, I wake up because I'm scared. I don't want to close my eyes and realise this thing is happening again.‚ÄùOkyere is now in Ankara, Turkey‚Äôs capital, after her coach arranged for her and her seven roommates to leave Hatay after the earthquake.But the ordeal left her scarred.‚ÄúI was terrified. I cried for days,‚Äù she explained.‚ÄúI can't imagine how lucky we were to get out from that situation, because most people couldn't get out. But we were able to.‚ÄùOkyere joined Hatayspor six months ago from Israeli club Tel-Aviv Beersheva.Like most people who live in southern Turkey, the club's players had felt tremors before. So when the earthquake struck in the early hours of Monday, she believed it was normal.‚ÄúWe were coming from a game in Istanbul and we weren't home until around 2am,"" she said.""We had to shower and then get some sleep. At first, I thought I was dreaming because since we came to Hatay, I experienced (tremors) it two times. Sometimes the building would just shake within 30 seconds and it stops.‚ÄúWhen it happened, I thought it was a normal thing but I realised this was much more intense than the previous ones.""She went to check on her team-mates, and then hurried outside as all around her began to crumble.‚ÄúWhen I got down, the buildings were just collapsing, and everybody was crying, trying to find shelter,"" she said.‚ÄúIt was raining heavily outside, and everyone was cold. We were not wearing any jackets - nothing. We had gone outside barefoot.‚ÄúWe weren't even thinking about how cold we were at that moment. What we wanted to think about was how to get our passports.‚ÄúWe had to find a shelter in someone's car for almost five hours before the whole thing calmed down, and then we were able to go back to the house.‚ÄùThough badly damaged, the building Okyere and her teammates lived in had not collapsed. But they had to leave the area, and with all public transport suspended, they wandered the streets looking for food.They were immediately concerned that there was no way to get in contact with their families back home, even as news began to filter out to the wider world of the quake.‚ÄúThe first thing that came into my mind was my mother, because she's always worried about where I am always want to know what is going on,‚Äù Okyere said.‚ÄúBut we couldn't communicate directly to our family because all the networks were not working.‚ÄúBut you could call within Turkey, So I spoke to my agent, and I gave him my mother's number so he could to talk with her and make sure that everything is okay.‚ÄùEventually, Okyere and her teammates were able to leave Hatay.While she and her teammates are safe, she said concern remains for other members of the wider Hatayspor club, including the men‚Äôs team and officials.‚ÄúWe don't know anything about the men's team because they live far from us, even though we live in the same city,"" she explained.‚ÄúBut our brother (Christian) Atsu, we always talk to him on phone. He texts us all the time.‚ÄúSince the incident happened, nobody knows his whereabouts. We don't even know what is happening.‚ÄùOkyere said she is trying to remain positive in the face of all the devastation, and her biggest wish right now is to go home to Ghana to spend some time with her family.‚ÄúFor Hatayspor our season is over because the city is destroyed,"" she said.""For management, we don't know anything about their whereabouts. So for us we know that for the men and the women the season is over,.‚ÄúWe will try to look for another club because I think that most clubs are also interested in some players from Hatayspor. I think hopefully maybe we will get something.‚ÄúFor me, only thing that is in my mind right now is I just want to go back to Ghana. At least have one week or two weeks rest with the family.‚Äù"

Huseyin Seferoglu, 23, had been trapped under the rubble for six and a half days, in the city of Antakya. His rescue was watched by the BBC's Tom Bateman."
397,Turkey earthquake failures leave Erdogan looking vulnerable,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64594349,"Turkey's most devastating earthquake since 1939 has raised big questions about whether such a large-scale tragedy could have been avoided and whether President Erdogan's government could have done more to save lives. With elections on the horizon, his future is on the line after 20 years in power and his pleas for national unity have gone unheeded.Recep Tayyip Erdogan has admitted shortcomings in the response, but he appeared to blame fate on a visit to one disaster zone: ""Such things have always happened. It's part of destiny's plan.""Turkey lies on two fault lines and has earthquake building codes dating back more than 80 years. But last Monday's double earthquake was far more intense than anything seen since 1939. The first quake registered magnitude 7.8 at 04:17, followed by another of 7.5 dozens of miles away. It required a massive rescue operation spread across 10 of Turkey's 81 provinces.But it took time for the response to build and some villages could not be reached for days. More than 30,000 people from the professional and voluntary sector eventually arrived, along with teams from many other countries. More than 6,000 buildings collapsed and workers from Turkey's Afad disaster authority were themselves caught up in the earthquakes.Those initial hours were critical but roads were damaged and search and rescue teams struggled to get through until day two or day three.Turkey has more experience of earthquakes than almost any other country but the founder of the main volunteer rescue group believes this time, politics got in the way.After the last major earthquake in August 1999, it was the armed forces who led the operation but the Erdogan government has sought to curb their power in Turkish society.""All over the world, the most organised and logistically powerful organisations are the armed forces; they have enormous means in their hands,"" said the head of Akut foundation, Nasuh Mahruki. ""So you have to use this in a disaster.""Instead, Turkey's civil disaster authority now has the role, with a staff of 10-15,000, helped by non-government groups such as Akut, which has 3,000 volunteers.The potential rescue effort was now far bigger than in 1999, Mr Mahruki said, but with the military left out of the planning it had to wait for an order from the government: ""This created a delay in the start of rescue and search operations.""President Erdogan has accepted that search efforts were not as fast as the government wanted, despite Turkey having the ""largest search and rescue team in the world right now"".For years, Turks have been warned of the potential of a big earthquake but few expected it to be along the East Anatolian fault, which stretches across south-eastern Turkey, because most of the larger tremors have hit the fault in the north.When a quake in January 2020 hit Elazig, north-east of Monday's disaster zone, geological engineer Prof Naci Gorur of Istanbul Technical University realised the risk. He even predicted a later quake north of Adiyaman and the city of Kahramanmaras.""I warned the local governments, governors, and the central government. I said: 'Please take action to make your cities ready for an earthquake.' As we cannot stop them, we have to diminish the damage created by them.""One of Turkey's foremost earthquake engineering specialists, Prof Mustafa Erdik, believes the dramatic loss of life was down to building codes not being followed, and he blames ignorance and ineptitude in the building industry. ""We allow for damage but not this type of damage - with floors being piled on top of each other like pancakes,"" he told the BBC. ""That should have been prevented and that creates the kind of casualties we have seen."" Under Turkish regulations updated in 2018, high-quality concrete has to be reinforced with ribbed, steel bars. Vertical columns and horizontal beams have to be able to absorb the impact of tremors.""There should be adhesion between the concrete and steel bars and there should also be adequate transfer reinforcement in the columns,"" explained Prof Erdik. Had all the regulations been followed, the columns would have survived intact and the damage would have been confined to the beams, he believes. Instead the columns gave way and the floors collapsed on top of each other, causing heavy casualties.The justice minister has said anyone found to have been negligent or at fault will be brought to justice.Critics such as opposition CHP party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu argue after 20 years in power President Erdogan's government has not ""prepared the country for the earthquakes"".One big question is what happened to the large sums collected through two ""earthquake solidarity taxes"" created after the 1999 quake. The funds were meant to make buildings resistant to earthquakes. One of the taxes, paid to this day by mobile phone operators and radio and TV, has brought some 88bn lira (¬£3.8bn; $4.6bn) into state coffers. It was even hiked to 10% two years ago. But the government has never fully explained where the money has been spent.Urban planners have complained that rules have not been observed in earthquake zones and highlight a 2018 government amnesty that meant violations of the building code could be swept away with a fine, and left some six million buildings unchanged. The fines brought in billions of Turkish lira in taxes and fees. But when a residential building in Istanbul collapsed in 2019, killing 21 people, the head of the chamber of civil engineers said the amnesty would turn Turkish cities into graveyards.More than 100,000 applications were made for an amnesty in the 10 cities currently affected, according to Pelin Pinar Giritlioglu of Istanbul University, who says there was a high intensity of illegal construction in the area.""The amnesty played an important role in the collapse of the buildings in the latest earthquake,"" she told the BBC. ""We cannot go anywhere by blaming each other and we should seek solutions,"" says Prof Erdik, who believes the problem goes beyond politics and lies in a system that allows engineers to go straight into practice after university with little experience.Prof Gorur calls for the creation of ""earthquake-resistant urban settlements"" but for that there will have to be a shift in thinking, nowhere more so than in Turkey's most populous city.""We have been warning about a possible Istanbul earthquake for 23 years. So the policymakers of Istanbul should come together and make policies to make people, the infrastructure, the buildings and the neighbourhoods resistant to an earthquake.""President Erdogan has called for unity and solidarity, denouncing critics of the disaster response as dishonourable.""I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest,"" he told reporters in Hatay, near the earthquake's epicentre. Many of the towns and cities in the affected areas are run by his ruling party, the AKP.But after 20 years in power, first as prime minister and then as an increasingly authoritarian, elected president, he leads a highly polarised country.""We have come to this point because of his politics,"" said Mr Kilicdaroglu.Campaigning for elections expected in May has not yet begun but he leads one of six opposition parties poised to announce a unified candidate in a bid to bring down the president.Mr Erdogan's hopes of unifying the country ahead of those elections are likely to fall on deaf ears.He has become increasingly intolerant of criticism and many of his opponents are in jail or have fled abroad. When an attempted coup against the president ended in bloodshed in 2016, he reacted by arresting tens of thousands of Turks and sacking civil servants. The economy has been in freefall with a 57% inflation rate leading to a sky-high cost of living.Among the government's first actions in response to the earthquake was temporarily blocking Twitter, which was being used in Turkey to help rescuers locate survivors. The government said it was being used to spread disinformation and police detained a political scientist for posting criticism of the emergency response.Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who spent a year in jail in pre-trial detention, wrote from exile in Germany that the aftermath of the 1999 Turkish earthquake helped propel Mr Erdogan to power. This latest disaster would play a part in the next vote too, he said, but it was not yet clear how.Turkey's Erdogan fighting to stay in power after 20 yearsWhy was the earthquake so deadly?Cost of living crisis gives Erdogan biggest poll test yet"
398,Jerusalem: Child killed in suspected ramming attack,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64584267,"Two Israelis - a six-year-old boy and 20-year-old man - have been killed in a car ramming attack at a bus stop in occupied East Jerusalem, officials say.The attack happened at Ramot Junction. Police say the driver, a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem, was ""neutralised on the spot"".Five people were hurt, medics said.It comes amid a particularly bloody period between Israelis and Palestinians, with a mounting toll from Palestinian attacks and Israeli raids.Pictures from the scene of the incident on the northern outskirts of the city show a blue Mazda car which had crashed into a pole and come to a standstill on the pavement under a bus shelter.A volunteer medic with an ambulance service told Israel's Army Radio: ""Everyone was lying out, thrown about, in very bad condition.""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had ""decided to take immediate action to seal and demolish the home of the terrorist"", his office said.Friday's attack is the latest in a spate of deadly incidents over the past couple of weeks which have ratcheted up tensions between Israel and the Palestinians.Late last month, 10 Palestinians, including two civilians, were killed in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin in an Israeli raid against militants that Israel said were planning an imminent attack. Hours later, a Palestinian gunman opened fire on Jewish worshippers and passers-by outside a synagogue in East Jerusalem, killing seven. The following morning, a 13-year-old Palestinian shot a group of people, also in East Jerusalem, wounding an Israeli father and son. During the past week, five Palestinian militants - some of whom Israel said had carried out a shooting attack at an Israeli restaurant - were killed in a gun battle with troops near the West Bank city of Jericho. Two Palestinians, whom Israel said had stabbed and shot at soldiers, were also shot dead by Israeli forces in the West Bank on Tuesday and Thursday.It brings to at least 39 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank so far this year, including militants and civilians, as a nearly year-long military operation against militants there continues. Eight Israelis and one Ukrainian have been killed in attacks by Palestinians also since the start of this year.UN envoy: Israel and Palestinians at critical pointBlinken's Jerusalem visit offers few solutions"

The Republican is a hotly tipped White House contender for 2024.Also on Friday, Florida lawmakers gave Mr DeSantis effective control of the board that oversees development in and around Disney's state theme parks, raising the stakes in his battle with the entertainment conglomerate, which he has labelled ""woke"".The bill authorises the governor to appoint five supervisors to run an oversight board of the area surrounding the Walt Disney World resort. The board has the power to delay or block development plans by Disney, such as to build a new theme park, hotel or road, on the 25,000 acres.""There's a new sheriff in town,"" Mr DeSantis said earlier this week as he claimed victory in his spat with the state's biggest private employer.Last year, Mr DeSantis flew undocumented migrants on two planes from Texas to the elite, predominantly liberal enclave of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.Democrats and their allies argued the flights were a political stunt that amounted to human-trafficking.But Republican lawmakers argued in Tallahassee during Thursday's floor debate on the new Unauthorized Alien Transport Program that it was ""humanitarian"" to offer a ""free, chartered flight"" for migrants who wanted to go elsewhere in the US.Texas and Arizona have also been transporting undocumented migrants by bus to Democratic-run cities such as Chicago and New York, and, Washington DC.New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, originally welcomed the migrants, but last July described them as a ""real burden"" on public services.Officials in the city have recently bought bus tickets to Canada for migrants.In fiscal year 2022 the number of undocumented immigrant crossings at the south-west US border topped 2.76 million, breaking the previous annual record by more than one million, according to Customs and Border Protection data.When Republican-controlled states first began transporting undocumented migrants to Democratic-controlled cities elsewhere in the US, it was dismissed by many as a publicity stunt with little serious impact. It turns out the programmes have generated a steady stream of national headlines for those spearheading them by causing some very real headaches for mayors in places like Washington DC, and New York City. Ron DeSantis has tried to get in on the action. His challenge, however, is that the number of undocumented migrants entering his state is relatively low.According to the New York Times, Mr DeSantis once groused to donors about Texas Governor Greg Abbott's ""good political fortune"" of being in a border state. He still tried his hand at migrant transportation, but he faced lawsuits over his programme's legality and funding,This new Florida law is designed to allow him to ramp up the flights and buses no matter where the migrants are located, giving him the ability to tout his hardline bona fides on immigration - in Florida and, perhaps, on the presidential campaign trail - without being overshadowed by his Texas counterpart.

403,Brett Favre: US football star files for defamation over Mississippi fraud claims,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64598725,"Former American football star Brett Favre has filed defamation lawsuits against Mississippi's state auditor and two popular sports media personalities.The Hall of Fame ex-quarterback is embroiled in a sprawling civil suit involving the alleged misuse of state welfare funds.Mr Favre, 53, has not been criminally charged and denies wrongdoing.His suits target state auditor Shad White, and commentators Shannon Sharpe and Pat McAfee.State investigators have been probing how $77m (¬£64m) in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds meant for the state's neediest families was made available to wealthy Mississippians for various purposes.Five people - including former professional wrestler Brett DiBiase - have so far pleaded guilty to federal and state charges in what has been described as the state's ""largest public fraud scheme"".Mr Favre was accused of diverting $5m to build a volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi, his alma mater, at the time his daughter played on the team.He was also reportedly paid $1.1m in TANF funds for speaking engagements that never occurred. He has repaid that sum in full, but Mr White's office argues he still owes $228,000 in interest payments.Investigators claim he knew he was receiving government money from an agency responsible for handling programs that help the poor, but Mr Favre strongly maintains he did not not.His suit against Mr White accuses the auditor of ""an outrageous media campaign of malicious and false accusations"" that traded on his ""celebrity"" for political gain.In a statement, the auditor's spokesman Fletcher Freeman responded by claiming that everything Mr White has said ""is true and is backed by years of audit work by the professionals at the Office of the State Auditor"".""Mr. Favre has called Auditor White and his team liars despite repaying some of the money our office demanded from him. He's also claimed the auditors are liars despite clear documentary evidence showing he benefitted from misspent funds,"" Mr Freeman said.Mr Favre's suits against Mr Sharpe and Mr McAfee accuse them of making ""egregiously false and defamatory statements"" about him on their respective shows.Mr Sharpe, co-host of the Fox Sports 1 show Skip and Shannon: Undisputed, referred to Mr Favre unfavourably and said he stole ""from the lowest of the low"", while Mr McAfee called him a ""thief"" who was ""stealing from poor people in Mississippi"" on The Pat McAfee Show podcast.Neither man has so far formally responded to the suit."
404,Narcocorridos: Mexico's bloody drug ballads have American ears tingling,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64337404,"Set to the tune of accordions and trumpets, the ballad ""In Preparation"" by California native Gerardo Ortiz could be mistaken for a jaunty polka.‚ÄØ  But its lyrics are chilling and brutal.‚ÄØ  ""If you aren't good at killing,"" Mr Ortiz blares, ""then you're good at dying.""  The song goes on to describe a combat-ready gunman with a penchant for trucks and his AK-47 who goes by a ""respected"" codename: M1.‚ÄØ  The man depicted is not fiction. M1 was the codename of a notorious Sinaloa Cartel drug trafficker, Manuel Torres Felix - or ""the Crazy One"" - who was gunned down in a firefight with Mexican soldiers in 2012.‚ÄØ  M1 may be dead but his infamy - and that of other gangsters past and present - live on in ""narcocorridos"", or drug ballads, which can be heard everywhere from small town fairs to nightclubs throughout Mexico.  The music draws on a deep tradition dating as far back as the Mexican Revolution, but with the zeitgeist of language and action ripped straight from the headlines.  Little wonder, then, that amid the grim reality of today's long and losing battle against cartel violence, the musical genre is dividing the opinions of listeners in its country of origin, as well as new audiences north of the border.  While the style of Mexican narcocorridos dates back to at least the early 20th Century, the genre - which has often been compared to the American tradition of gangster rap - first became popular in the US in the 1980s.  Its initial popularity in the US was largely due to Chalino Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant in the Los Angeles area still popularly known as the king of narcocorridos.  Sanchez's life, in many ways, was as violent as the subjects of his music. In 1992, he narrowly escaped death after being shot twice in a gunfight at a California concert. Four months later, he was kidnapped and executed just hours after receiving a threatening note while on stage at a concert in Mexico.  This video can not be playedListen to the 'drug ballads' popular in CaliforniaIn the decades after his death, the genre he popularised has remained a draw for many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the US, where it has a dedicated audience. ""I like that the music tells real stories of real people,"" said Alex Fernandez, a first-generation American who lives in southern California, just a few miles from the border with Mexico. ""People like crime movies, or gangster rap. It's the same thing."" Firm numbers of US-based listeners of narcocorridos are hard to come by, but the potential audience is in the millions. Mexican ""regional music"" - the broad genre in which corridos fall - is the strongest performing format among Hispanic radio consumers, according to Nielsen.  The audience among streaming listeners is potentially even larger, with Spotify noting that the volume of streams of the genre has more than doubled since 2019 to reach 5.6bn - 21% of which is from the US.  Among the songs currently on his corrido playlist, Mr Fernandez tells the BBC, is ""30 Armoured Trucks"", a song about a convoy of vehicles working at the behest of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel.  Another song - El ""Raton"", or ""the mouse"" - is sung from the perspective of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, the son of imprisoned cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, whose arrest this month led to a series of fierce gun battles and dozens of deaths. ""I don't know fear,"" the singer croons. ""A Guzman can't be intimidated, especially by the government.""  The content of the music - much of which is inspired by real people and events - has prompted recent bans on radio circulation and live performances in some parts of Mexico and at events seen as potentially related to the drug trade.  In November, organisers of a weeks-long livestock festival in the violence-plagued Mexican state of Sinaloa announced that corridos were forbidden because they promote bloodshed. But for many US listeners, the content of the music - which often portrays drug traffickers as Robin Hood-like figures opposing the government - is part of the appeal.  The popularity of the music among some US-based listeners is directly comparable to the rise of gangster rap in the mid-1980s, according to Rafael Acosta, a professor at the University of Kansas who has studied narcocorridos. ""Gangster rap has been naturalised into massive culture, and it's not very different, in function, even if it is in style,"" he said.Narcocorridos tell the stories of ""people who feel, many times justifiably, that they are neglected by state and economic apparatuses and look for possibilities of rebellion and socio-economic advancement,"" said Prof Acosta. He compared them to films and songs about Italian gangsters at the turn of the 20th Century or outlaws trafficking moonshine during the prohibition of the 1920s. But critics who denounce the genre point to the music's relationship with real-life violent incidents and the perceived association between the musicians and criminals. Well over a dozen narcocorrido singers have been killed in Mexico in recent years, while others have been accused by authorities of being involved in crimes themselves.  The violent nature of the music is a ""complicated"" issue, even for fans, said Prof Acosta.  For some, there are even signs that fatigue over years of drug-related violence in Mexico has led some fans to turn away from the music.  Howard Campbell, a professor at the University of Texas - El Paso who researches drug trafficking and the culture of the US-Mexico border, has found that the music's popularity in the region has waned.  This trend is partly due to the fact that many in El Paso have grown weary of the imagery of a drug war that has claimed thousands of lives just across the border, he said.  ""How many times can you show the same narco videos, of people popping champagne with women and guns? It gets stale at a certain point,"" he said. ""It starts to lose its chic and cool aspects. The reality is that it's a horrible situation.""  ""It's something that will never completely go away,"" he continued. ""But I don't think it's likely to regain the heights that it once had.""

The incident happened in June 2022. A hole had to be cut into the bottom of the partly-full tank to get them out.More than two dozen rescuers responded, and one worker was transported to hospital by helicopter, according to local reports.The regulator's report labelled the incident ""serious"". It says the workers were hired to clean tanks, and were not provided with proper safety training.It noted that the workers fell into a batching tank - a tank used to mix ingredients - for Dove chocolate, a brand sold in the US. In the UK and elsewhere, Dove is sold as Galaxy.A representative for Mars Wrigley welcomed the outcome of the investigation.""The safety of our associates and outside contractors is a top priority for our business,"" said the spokesperson.

The incident began when the two met Mr Facey to buy a watch but believed it was counterfeit, according to the SIU.The April 26, 2021 meeting in Brampton, a city in the Greater Toronto Area, led to a foot chase, which ended with Mr Au holding Mr Facey on the ground while the second off-duty officer demanded the money be returned, according to Toronto police disciplinary hearing documents obtained by CBC and CTV News. The two men left the scene without reporting the incident. The 19-year-old died in hospital hours later. His cause of death has not been released.The province of Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) launched its investigation in August of that year, after the incident was reported to Toronto police by the Peel Region police, which oversees Brampton. The second off-duty officer involved in the incident, Const Gurmakh Benning, faces disciplinary charges but not criminal charges, according to the Toronto Police Service.Mr Facey's mother, Fay Fagan, reacted to the charges on Friday, saying ""it has been clear to our family that there was some kind of misconduct"" in her son's death.""We are happy to finally see that the officer is being held accountable for his actions,"" she said in a statement through the family's lawyer.Police name man allegedly stabbed to death by girlsToronto police sorry for 'systematic racism'Toronto struggles with wave of transit violenceHuman rights inquiry into Toronto police"
408,Federal agents search Mike Pence's home - reports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64499785,"The FBI has found an additional classified document in a search of former US Vice-President Mike Pence's home in Indiana.It follows disclosures by his attorneys that they found ""a small number"" of classified files from his vice-presidency at the home last month.An adviser for Mr Pence confirmed that additional files were removed following ""a thorough and unrestricted search"". Mr Pence agreed to the consensual search, he added. ""The Department of Justice completed a thorough and unrestricted search of five hours and removed one document with classified markings and six additional pages without such markings that were not discovered in the initial review by the vice-president's counsel,"" said adviser Devin O'Malley in a statement on Friday. The search was conducted by FBI agents from Indianapolis and is not currently linked to other investigations into classified files, CBS, the BBC's US partner, reported.It is the latest development in a growing controversy over classified documents that has already embroiled both former President Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden.Mr Trump faces a criminal investigation for allegedly mishandling classified documents, while Mr Biden faces a probe by the US Department of Justice.A spokesperson for Mr Pence told CNN he was away, though a private attorney was present at the house.In January, representatives for Mr Pence sent a letter to the National Archives - the US government agency that manages the preservation of presidential records - alerting them that they had found classified documents in the former vice-president's home.Those materials have already been handed over to the FBI.Classified records are supposed to go to the National Archives once an administration leaves office.The documents were ""inadvertently boxed and transported"" to Mr Pence's home at the end of the Trump presidency, an attorney for Mr Pence has said. The documents were found after Mr Pence sought legal help from specialists in handling classified documents ""out of an abundance of caution"", following the discovery of classified files at Mr Biden's Delaware home and his private Washington DC office.The FBI search of Mr Pence's residence comes after a search of Mr Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on 1 February.No additional classified files were found in the nearly four-hour search of that property, lawyers for the president have said. Mr Biden has said that his team did ""what they should have done"" by alerting officials immediately when classified files were found and that he is co-operating with the special counsel's investigation.The FBI did not need to obtain a warrant for searches of Mr Biden's property, as his lawyers had agreed to the probe.The federal agency did, however, obtain a warrant for their search of Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida last year for classified documents. To date, about 300 classified documents have been recovered from Mr Trump since his administration ended. The search warrant came after attorneys representing Mr Trump had said all government records had been returned. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he declassified any documents he took when he left the White House.Mr Pence was recently issued a legal summons to testify in the investigation into Mr Trump. Sources have said the subpoena is related to the ex-president's bid to overturn his 2020 election defeat.A simple guide to the US classified documents sagaClassified documents found at Mike Pence's homeNo classified files found at Biden home, lawyer saysWhy politicians keep misplacing classified documents"
409,Autism: The touring exhibition showcasing talented young artists,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64561389,"A touring art exhibition is giving young people who are autistic an opportunity to express themselves. The Creative Voices: What Autism Means to Me exhibition showcases more than 140 pieces of art created by autistic post-primary pupils from schools right across Northern Ireland.Each artwork is accompanied by a personalised quote from the artist.The exhibit aims to give people a better understanding of autism from the personal perspectives of each artist. Autism is known as a ""spectrum condition"" as it affects people in a variety of ways and to varying degrees.It can impact how a person communicates with and relates to other people and how they make sense of the world.Each piece of art on display allows the artist to communicate what their individual autism means to them.The exhibition was being held in the Flowerfield Art Centre in Portstewart, County Londonderry, but is now moving on to The Braid Museum and Art Centre in Ballymena from 16 March until 15 April.The whole exhibition is travelling across various locations in a tour of Northern Ireland throughout 2023.  The project is presented by the Education Authority's Autism Advisory and Intervention Service (AAIS).The Education Authority's Gillian Whiteside said the exhibition provides young people with an opportunity to showcase and celebrate their creative talents, and aims to increase understanding and acceptance of autism within the wider community.  ""The idea blossomed from our work with pupils on increasing their personal understanding and self-acceptance of autism,"" she said. ""We felt the pupil's voice should be at the heart of the exhibition and it should be a vehicle for each of them to express their own personal and individual experience of autism.""Ms Whiteside said the main aim of the exhibit is to give a greater understanding and acceptance of autism within the wider community.""Only then can we truly have an inclusive society where neurodiversity is celebrated,"" she said.  For Molly's artwork she decided to paint a character named Ella that represents her autism. Molly said autism can be a difficult thing to explain to people - she wanted to make it easier to understand through Ella. ""I have a deep connection to animals, music and bright colours so that is why those things are in there.""Molly said that autism ""brings out the best in a person"" and should not be viewed negatively. In her quote attached to her artwork, Molly said autism ""makes us unique in ways people aren't able to see and it makes us better people"".She said the painting took more than a week to complete and that she was incredibly proud of how it turned out.Emma's artwork was all about about highlighting the many positives associated with being autistic. ""I view my autism as my ability not a disability,"" Emma told BBC News NI. ""I have great memory, I'm very precise when it comes to detail, I'm very punctual and I'm very honest and reliable."" Emma said the bright butterfly depicted in the painting is a metaphor for her autism, with it being a guiding light in contrast to the dark background.Emma decided not to take Art as a GCSE, but said she will continue painting and being creative. Shauna McNeilly, arts and cultural facilities officer at Flowerfield Art Centre, said the exhibit had been a joy to display.""It really represents what autism means to so many young people and it is a celebration of creativity,"" Ms McNeilly said. ""It lets any viewer of the work know more about autism, what it actually is and how it varies from individual to individual.""Ms McNeilly said they have been blown away by the response and said the centre has been inundated with positive feedback about the wonderful artwork on display.""So many people, myself included, have learned so much about autism from the wonderful array of quotes and colourful drawings and pictures.""Proportion of NI pupils with autism quadruplesYoung carers struggling at school, report finds'We are proud of our autistic brains'"

His quartet of prizes included best artist, best pop act and song of the year, for the ubiquitous and wonderful As It Was.He also won the controversial best artist prize - which was created last year after separate male and female categories were merged. Aware that no women had been nominated in the category, Styles dedicated the prize to the people he'd usurped.""I'm very aware of my privilege up here tonight, so this award is for Rina [Sawayama], Charli [XCX], Florence, Mabel and Becky [Hill], thank you so much.""Sam Smith waddled onto the red carpet in a custom-made black latex outfit by London fashion house Harri.So voluminous was the costume that they had to forgo the standard golf buggy from the dressing room, and teeter around the outskirts of the O2 in high heels.Fans, meanwhile, couldn't decide whether Smith was paying tribute to David Bowie or a spatchcock chicken.Bowie did it better!#SamSmith vs #Bowie pic.twitter.com/m6xR1NDTDDSam Smith turning up to the brits like a burnt chicken pic.twitter.com/I3rZxn8Q9P""There's a singer-songwriter who is the spirit of the Brit Awards distilled in human form,"" announced host Mo Gilligan from the floor of the O2 Arena.""Here with his amazing number one single Forget Me, it's the brilliant Sam Capaldi.""Sam Capaldi?

Acknowledging the situation was ""disappointing"", a spokesperson for the awards added: ""We also have to recognise that 2022 saw fewer high-profile female artists in cycle with major releases, as was the case in 2021.""Charli XCX was not impressed.""I've heard a lot of chat about the fact that there weren't enough females in album cycle,"" she told BBC News. ""But I was in album cycle, and I had a number one album - and there's many of us.""We're doing everything right, so I don't think it's our fault. ""I think it might be theirs.""Rina Sawayama has experience of getting the Brits to change their mind. In 2020, the Japanese-British singer discovered she wasn't eligible for the awards because she doesn't hold a British passport (Japan doesn't allow dual citizenship) and successfully petitioned organisers to change their rules.Asked about the lack of female representation this year, she said one simple change could fix the problem.""The problem is that they combined the male and female categories, but they didn't expand the number of nominees,"" she said. ""So I really just want to see the categories get bigger. That's what the Grammys do. ""People don't realise, even a nomination can change an artist's life and it's a shame to take that away because there's only five spots available.""Wet Leg arrived at the Brits fresh from Los Angeles, where they'd just won two Grammy Awards. But they didn't get to bring their trophies home with them.""I think they pop them in the post,"" said singer Rhian Teasdale, who was surprised to discover the awards they received on stage weren't the real deal. ""They had a big mountain of them backstage, and they were like, 'You have a Grammy!

""There's an idea that American R&B artists can be commercially successful, and we [in the UK] can't.

But at other ceremonies, this has often resulted in an imbalance in favour of men. The Brit Awards attracted criticism this year after their decision to merge best male and best female into one best artist category resulted in an all-male shortlist, which Harry Styles ultimately won.The first gender-neutral WhatsOnStage Awards saw men nominated in all of the major acting categories, but the four main prizes went to women.They were Comer for Prima Facie, To Kill a Mockingbird's Gwyneth Keyworth, and Legally Blonde stars Courtney Bowman and Lauren Drew.The decision to merge the gendered categories meant the number of acting prizes was almost halved, although the ceremony maintained separate awards for plays and musicals.However, the awards body also introduced an additional acting prize this year for newcomers. The inaugural best professional debut trophy was won by 19-year-old Joe Locke, who appeared in The Trials at the Donmar Warehouse.

Bonnie & Clyde the Musical and Rodgers & Hammerstein's Oklahoma! won best new musical and best musical revival respectively, while Prima Facie and Cock were named best new play and best play revival.

412,Cinema in the back of a lorry pops up in Newmarket,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-64597570,"A 100-seater cinema in the back of a lorry has opened in a town that has not had a picture house for decades.Organisers said they hoped to gauge the local appetite for a cinema in Newmarket, Suffolk, by setting up the attraction for 10 days.There are plans to turn the former home of National Horseracing Museum into a venue for films. David Hall, from the charity behind the scheme, said it would give the town a ""boost"".The pop-up cinema has been set up at the The Severals Sports Pavilion until 19 February, with four to five showings a day.Mr Hall, director of the Newmarket Charitable Foundation, said: ""For the length of half-term, local kids and adults are going to be able to be entertained at a 100-seater cinema, how cool is that?""Of the mobile facility, he said, ""you would not believe you are in the back of a lorry"", adding it was air-conditioned and had ""high quality seats"".Newmarket used to have two cinemas but one closed in the 1960s and another shut down in the 1970s.He said the charity was working with Jockey Club Estates to develop plans to turn the old horseracing museum into a three-screen boutique picture house.Mr Hall said it would be ""fabulous"" to have a cinema back in the town. ""From an economy point of view, it means that people would stop leaving the town of an evening to go to either Cambridge or Bury St Edmunds.""To have a cinema in the town would provide a boost to the high street,"" he added. He said they were gauging evidence of the local appetite with a questionnaire so they could then potentially apply for funding.Nick Patton, from Jockey Club Estates, said a lot of work would need to go into developing a cinema at the 250-year-old building. The building has been empty since the museum moved seven years ago .Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

417,Ukraine war: Russians slowly take ground around Bakhmut,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64596363,"""Stay close to the wall. Move fast. Single file. Just a few at a time.""The staccato instructions come from the Ukrainian army escort taking us to a military position in battle-scarred Bakhmut, a city once famed for its sparkling wines.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the eastern city ""our fortress"". Russian forces have spent the past six months trying to capture Bakhmut. Now they have intensified their onslaught - Ukraine believes - to tear it down ahead of the anniversary of the invasion. We follow orders, darting down an icy rubble-strewn street, with a clear blue sky overhead - ideal for Russian drones.Just after we cross the road, two Russian shells come slamming down behind us on the other side. We turn around to see black smoke rising and keep on running. Was the shelling random or aimed at us? We can't be sure, but everything that moves in Bakhmut is a target - soldier or civilian.  For hours there is no let-up in the shelling, incoming and outgoing. A Russian fighter jet roars overhead. The nearest Russian troops are just two kilometres away. There is street fighting in some areas, but Ukrainian forces still hold the city - despite sub-zero temperatures and dwindling ammunition. ""We have some shortages of ammunition of all kinds, especially artillery rounds,"" says Capt Mykhailo from the 93rd Mechanised Brigade, whose call sign is 'Polyglot'. ""We also need encrypted communication devices from our Western allies, and some armoured personnel carriers to move troops around. But we still manage. One of the main lessons of this war is how to fight with limited resources.""This video can not be playedCapt Mykhailo says Ukrainian forces have to work with limited resourcesWe get an insight into the ammunition problems as Ukrainian troops target a Russian position with 60mm mortars. The first mortar round flies from the tube with a loud bang. The second round doesn't eject. There's a hiss of smoke and a shout of ""misfire"" sending the mortar unit scrambling for cover. Troops tell us the ammunition is old stock, sent from abroad.The battle for Bakhmut is a war within a war. Some of the fiercest fighting of the invasion has happened here. And now the Kremlin's forces are gaining ground, metre by metre, body by body. Wave after wave of mercenaries from the notorious Wagner group have been sent into battle here. There are reports of fields of Russian corpses.Moscow now has effective control of both main roads into the city, leaving just one back route left - a slender supply line.  ""They have been trying to take the city since July,"" says Iryna, press officer of the 93rd Brigade. ""Little by little they are winning now. They have more resources, so if they play the long game they will win. I can't say how long it will take. ""Maybe they will run out of resources. I really hope so.""  We move from carefully concealed firing positions to bunkers humming with generators and warmed by stoves. But troops take care to conceal any smoke which could give away their location - part of the housekeeping of war. Among those we meet there is calm determination to fight on. ""They are trying to encircle us so that we leave the city, but it's not working,"" says Ihor, a camouflage-clad commander, with a battle-hardened edge. ""The city is under control. Transport moves, despite constant artillery strikes. Of course, we have losses from our side, but we are holding on. We only have one option - to keep going to victory.""There is another option - to withdraw from Bakhmut before it's too late. But among the defenders on the ground there seems little appetite for that. ""If we have such an order from our HQ, OK, order is order,"" says Captain Myhailo. ""But what sense to hold all these months if you need to retreat from this city? No, we don't want to do this."" He recalls those who have given their lives for Bakhmut - ""a lot of good brave men who just love this country.""And if the defenders of Bakhmut were to withdraw, it would pave the way for Russia to push towards bigger cities in eastern Ukraine like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Moscow has stepped up its attacks in other front-line areas in the Donbas region in the east, and in the south. Ukrainian officials say a new Russian offensive is already under way.The Kremlin is on a clock, as it counts down to the anniversary on 24 February. ""They are mad about dates and so-called 'victory days',"" says Capt Mykhailo.  But the battle of attrition for Bakhmut could wear out the Russians, according to Viktor, a tall, lean Ukrainian commander who has captured Russian magazines on a shelf in his bunker.""They don't defend now,"" he says, ""they just attack. They continue taking some metres, but we are trying to make sure they take as little of our land as possible.  We are holding the enemy here and wearing them out.""Perhaps. There is still some life in Bakhmut if you know where to find it.A blast of heat and light hits you when you walk through the door of the ""invincibility hub"", past boxes of donated food supplies. It's a boxing club turned life-support system where local people can recharge their phones and themselves, with hot food and companionship.It was crowded when we visited, with elderly women clustered around a stove, and two young boys sitting in the boxing ring, glued to a TV screen, and playing war games.Around 5,000 civilians remain in Bakhmut without running water or power - many are elderly and poor. ""Some are pro-Moscow. They are waiting for the Russians,"" a Ukrainian colleague mutters darkly.   All here are fighting their own battles says Tetiana, a 23-year-old psychologist who is at the hub watching over her young brother and sister. She's still in Bakhmut because her 86-year-old grandmother can't move and relies on her.""Most people deal with it by praying to God,"" she says. ""Faith helps. Some forget that they are people. Some show aggression. They start behaving worse than animals.""Back outside the battle for this broken city rages on, with a drum beat of shelling as we leave.Almost one year on since the start of the conflict, what questions do you have about the war in Ukraine?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

418,The boxer who fled Iran seeking the freedom to fight,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64514162,"Sadaf Khadem trains at her boxing club in Royan on the south-west coast of France three nights a week. The Iranian-born boxer hopes one day to go professional.  Several posters of the 28-year-old in her boxing outfit are pinned to the club walls. But Sadaf has paid a big personal price for her passion - living in exile here in France for the past three years.She took up the sport in Tehran, shadow-boxing in the parks or discreetly in boxing rings as women are not allowed to box in Iran.Desperate to progress in the sport and through contacts in the Iranian diaspora in France, a bout was set up in the coastal town of Royan in 2019. The local boxing club president Franck Weus, a former boxer and local community leader, took up the challenge. Around 40% of the boxers in his club are women and he even raised the money to fly Sadaf over for the fight, which attracted 1,500 spectators.""I immediately accepted the job because there is boxing and the sport of course, but also the human factor to take into account,"" he tells me. ""An Iranian woman who wants to box but is not allowed to at home. We know about all the hurdles they face and especially now with hundreds dead simply because they want to remove their veil.""He is referring to the mass protests that have erupted in Iran since the death of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, last September. She died in custody after being arrested by morality police allegedly for not wearing her hijab correctly. Her death has sparked demonstrations across the country, which have left hundreds of mainly young protesters and dozens of members of the security services dead, according to human rights groups. Thousands of demonstrators have been arrested although Iran's supreme leader has indicated many may be pardoned. Four men accused by the Iranian authorities of participating in a violent uprising have been executed in very swift trials. Sadaf Khadem won her bout and on her return to the airport to fly home she received the news that she faced arrest on her arrival for boxing and practising a sport without wearing a veil or hijab. So she turned back - and has stayed put in France ever since. ""I know the situation of Iran and unfortunately I am not with the people of Iran, but my life and my home now is France,"" she says. ""I say we don't have accidents in life. I paid for being Sadaf Khadem, the first Iranian female boxer. So I don't say why me? All the things that happened to me, I don't say why me?""Sadaf's plight has struck a chord in this part of south-western France. She was invited to a reception by her local MP, Christophe Plassard, who is trying to pull strings to get her a French passport.""She would like to have French citizenship but she doesn't tick all the right boxes because she hasn't been here five years,"" he tells me, adding: ""But I am trying because she has earned it and her combat is extraordinary.""At the reception, Sadaf wore clothing that might well have landed her in trouble in Tehran. Something she often highlights in photos she publishes on her social media accounts for her supporters back in Iran. ""Every day on my Instagram or email I receive too many messages: 'To Sadaf, when I see the ways of your life we are motivated to continue for our lives.' For me it's a pleasure, an honour for me. I am very happy that I am good motivation for many people too.""When she's not boxing, Sadaf is getting a diploma in marketing alongside work experience. Moved by her story, Corrine Huet volunteered to be her business coach and adviser at a training school in Royan. ""I'm a mother of five children and as a teacher there was no way I could ignore her call for help,"" she says. ""She deserves it - she's a fighter"".Since her self-imposed exile began three years ago, Sadaf has met her father and sisters once a year in either Turkey or Dubai. Being exiled meant that she was unable to be by her mother's side when she died with Covid in Iran.She is reluctant to give advice to those her age fighting for freedom back home because of the risks they face. ""I found the courage in France that I never had in Iran. What is important is I found some humanity here. Unfortunately because of this government in Iran the people there have lost their human rights.""She has no idea if she still faces arrest if she tries to return home. A spokesman at the Iranian embassy in Paris told me he had nothing to say on the matter.Why reporting on Iran comes at a heavy priceIdentifying those killed in Iran's protests"
419,Two men jailed for facilitating teenager's murder,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn02vn4g21lo,"Keane Mulready-Woods' body was dismembered after his murder in January 2020 Two men who admitted facilitating the murder of a 17-year-old have been jailed at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.Keane Mulready-Woods from Drogheda, County Louth, was murdered in January 2020 and his body was dismembered.Paul Crosby, aged 27, from Rathmullan Park in Drogheda, and 49-year-old Gerard Cruise were sentenced on Friday.Crosby was jailed for 10 years and Cruise was jailed for seven years.The teenager's dismembered remains were discovered at three separate locations in January 2020.Keane Mulready-Woods' disappearance was reported by his mother on 13 January 2020. He was on bail and subject to a curfew when he went missing.Garda√≠ (Irish police) believe the murder was related to the ongoing feud between two Drogheda criminal gangs, which has now cost four lives.The teenager was lured to a house in Drogheda where he was murdered and his body was then dismembered with hand and power tools.  His arms and legs were discovered in a sports bag in Coolock in north Dublin the following day. Two days later, his head and feet were discovered in the boot of a stolen car found ablaze in Dublin's north inner city. Further remains, including his torso, were found at a location in Rathmullen Park. His cause of death is unknown. Multiple searches were carried out in the Rathmullan Park area of DroghedaThe court heard the chief suspect for the murder was Robbie Lawlor,  a senior criminal involved in the Drogheda gang feud, Irish broadcaster RT√â reported. He was linked to several other murders and was shot dead in Belfast in April 2020.Mr Justice Hunt described the feud as ""a scourge of the locality and a matter of nationwide concern"".Man admits facilitating Drogheda teen's murderFuneral of murdered Drogheda teenager takes placeMr Justice Hunt said it was unnatural for any parent to lose a child prematurely, particularly through murder.He said the remains of Mulready-Woods were treated in a disgraceful, inhuman way which compounded his family's grief.In a victim impact statement, Keane's mother, Elizabeth Woods, described his killing as ""one of the most brutal, traumatic murders in the history of Ireland"".Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar visited Drogheda after the murder and pledged to make the area safeThe court heard Crosby had met Keane Mulready-Woods on the day he went missing, paid for his taxi fare and took him to a car where Cruise drove them to the rear of a property in Rathmullan Park, where the child was then murdered.Listing evidence, Detective Inspector Aidan McCabe said the two men had bought a van in which Mulready-Woods' bone fragments were later found.Cruise had provided bags later found at the murder scene, one of which contained a drill. He had also bought false registration plates for a car later used to move the child's remains to Dublin.Both men apologised for what happened with Cruise insisting he did not know Mulready-Woods was to be murdered.There was no evidence either men were present when the murder took place, but Crosby was in contact with Lawlor by phone. Both men's phones were also found at the murder scene.The court found Paul Crosby to be the more senior of the two men chargedMr Justice Hunt said the assistance they gave was significant, relating to a crime before, during and after it happened.The court was satisfied Crosby was the more senior of the two as he received directions from Lawlor and passed them on to others.It also found Cruise's previous convictions to be less serious.Crosby was sentenced to ten-and-a-half years with the last six months suspended, while Cruise was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years with the last six months suspended.Upon sentencing, Mr Justice Hunt added that nothing the court said could address the plight of the Mulready-Woods family. Remains found in car also confirmed as teenager'sRemains confirmed as those of missing teenager"
420,Blue Jean: The lesbian teachers who inspired film about Section 28,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64426890,"Bafta-nominated Blue Jean follows a lesbian PE teacher in the late 1980s at the time when a controversial law banned the ""promotion of homosexuality"" in schools. Two women who inspired the film recall the impact of Section 28 on them.Coming face-to-face with a younger version of yourself must be a very strange experience. Especially if that younger self is going through one of the most difficult periods of your life.That was how Catherine Lee felt as she watched a PE teacher in her 20s, her short blonde hair uncannily similar to her own, taking netball practice in a high school sports hall.""It was just like the gym I used to teach in every day,"" Lee says.She experienced this surreal sort of time travel by visiting the set of Blue Jean, a new British film shot in Newcastle and set in the late '80s, which is partly inspired by her story and those of other gay teachers.  From behind the cameras, Lee watched as the actress playing the young teacher intervened when the lesson descended into taunts, and a homophobic slur was shouted.""I hadn't heard that word for so many years, and my reaction... it was almost visceral,"" Lee says. ""It took all my restraint to not put my fingers in my ears.""Emotionally, I was affected far more than I expected to be.""In the film, Jean, played by Rosy McEwen, must navigate a tricky web of relationships at school and in her private life, at a time when public and political attitudes to homosexuality made it a fierce moral battleground.Introduced in 1988, Section 28 was designed to safeguard traditional family values and protect children, according to supporters. Opponents called it ""state-sponsored homophobia"". For many gay teachers, it meant not just avoiding references to sexuality in lessons, but fearing for their jobs if they came out, or supported students who were struggling with their own sexuality, or confronted homophobic bullying. For gay teenagers, it fuelled that bullying and a sense of shame.Lee, a PE teacher in Liverpool at the time, told McEwen about her experiences.""We spoke at length about what it was like to be permanently anxious at school, never in the moment, always thinking two steps ahead in case somebody was going to ask you what you did at the weekend, or ask you to go to the pub, and cross the professional into the personal.""Seeing Rosy as Jean embody that, and be so small and anxious and timid in those school scenes - it affected me really profoundly,"" continues Lee.""I went from feeling sorry for her and wanting to put my arm around her and tell her that it would all be OK, to wanting to shake her and feeling really angry with her for not being bolder.""Lee is now a professor at Anglia Ruskin University and has just published Pretended: Schools and Section 28, drawing on her diaries from the time.Sarah Squires, who taught in Exeter and London, also advised the film's makers. Section 28 contributed to ""internalised homophobia"" that she is still processing today, she says.When she visited the set, Squires was shown a clip of Jean and other teachers in the staff room watching a news report about a Section 28 debate in the Houses of Parliament.McEwen ""conveys this absolute turmoil, this inner struggle, so brilliantly"", Squires says. ""I was absolutely in tears just watching that piece of footage. It just hit me right here in the solar plexus.""They've managed to capture the constant inner turmoil. You were constantly vigilant, always having to present this almost two-dimensional version of yourself because you're checking yourself. You're constantly on guard and need to make sure what you're saying doesn't give you away. So you're undercover the whole time.""The film is up for the best debut award at next week's Baftas, and recently won four British Independent Film Awards including best lead performance for McEwen.""When I finally saw Rosy convey this person, I had to just find her and thank her and I hugged her, and it felt a bit like hugging my former self for getting through it somehow,"" adds Squires, now a principal lecturer at Leeds Beckett University.""It was quite a triggering experience and a very interesting reaction.""Section 28 stopped councils and schools ""promoting the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship"".It was in force until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Paul Baker, author of Outrageous!: The Story of Section 28 and Britain's Battle for LGBT Education, says he is not aware of any successful prosecutions.""I think people did lose their jobs over it, but often it wasn't put down explicitly to Section 28,"" he says.""There was a lot of self-censorship. People were so scared of losing their jobs, or getting into the newspapers, that they just kept quiet. They didn't use certain books in English literature classes and things like that. If there was bullying, they turned a blind eye to it.""I have had teachers write to me, saying how terrible they now feel about things they let slide or didn't confront.""Georgia Oakley went to school in the late '90s and early 2000s, but only became aware of Section 28 when she came across articles about it later.""Immediately, I started thinking about what effect this law must have had on my life without my even knowing that it had existed,"" she says.""I was also simultaneously thinking about what it must have been like for a queer teacher at that time, and the domino effect on anyone that was a student.""Now 34 and a film-maker, Oakley decided that story should be told. She has written and directed Blue Jean.She thinks Section 28, along with wider prejudices, had the effect of stopping many people being open about their sexuality.""My experience of growing up was that there was just a complete absence of queer role models,"" she says.""I wasn't aware of anybody in my life or the public eye, particularly when we're speaking about women. I wasn't aware of any lesbians in my life - in my school, within my teachers, within my parents' friends - which actually of course was not true.""This year is the 20th anniversary of the end of Section 28. With its 1980s setting, Blue Jean is an evocative period piece.There are, though, parallels with laws that have recently been introduced in Florida, Russia and Hungary.""I suppose one message that I hope is communicated is that we can never get complacent about our rights because everything is delicate,"" Oakley says. And while much is now different, some things are not, she says.""There's a whole load of Jean's experience that is still relevant now. And not just relevant, but things that I experience all the time. Little micro aggressions. In that respect, not much has changed.""Blue Jean is in UK cinemas from Friday.The LGBT history you probably didn't learn in schoolBeing LGBTQ+ 18 years after anti-gay education lawSection 28 backer 'sorry' if people hurt"

422,Teachers' strike: National Education Union to join action,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-64603735,"A fourth teaching union is to join a widespread half-day strike in Northern Ireland on 21 February.The National Education Union (NEU) has notified education management bodies its members will join the strike.Teachers in three other unions - the NASUWT, INTO and UTU - had already decided to walk out from midnight to 12:00 GMT.About 66% of NEU members who voted in a formal ballot, which closed on Friday, have decided to join the strike.The union has now notified the Department of Education (DE) and the teaching employers, including the Education Authority (EA), of its intention to strike.The action by the four unions is due to continuing stalemate over a pay deal.A letter to principals from the Education Authority's chief executive Sara Long, representing the management bodies and employers, said schools should expect ""significant disruption"".But the management bodies have previously advised principals only to close schools as ""a last resort"".In a message to NEU members in Northern Ireland, the union's regional secretary Mark Langhammer said they had a ""decisive mandate"" to strike.""What angered our teachers is the long-term under-funding of schools, and our children, and of course our teachers,"" he said.The union's vice-president in Northern Ireland, Edel McInerney, said the decision to strike was ""ultimately a sad day"".""NEU are slow to anger, moderate and reflective,"" she said.""The toxic equilibrium of increased job intensity and decreased job satisfaction has taken its toll.""This is an absolute last resort for our members.""The responsibility for any disruption to schools lies squarely with the employing authorities and the Department of Education.""The NAHT union, which represents many Northern Ireland school leaders, had previously decided not to join the 21 February strike.It said it supported the action taken by other unions but wanted to give some more time for the pay dispute to be settled.There has been no resolution to the dispute since unions rejected a two-year pay offer as ""inadequate"" in February 2022.The unions have since asked for a ""cost-of-living"" pay increase of 6% for 2021-22 and a rise of inflation plus 2% for 2022-23.Inflation is currently running at over 10%.Meanwhile, a teachers' strike planned in Wales for next Tuesday has been called off after a new Welsh government pay offer.Teachers in Wales have been offered an extra 1.5% on this year's 5% pay award, as well as a 1.5% one-off payment.Majority of NI teachers to hold half-day strikeNI teaching unions consider joint strike actionTeaching unions brand pay offer inadequateWhy are prices rising so much?When are teachers striking, and what are they paid?"
423,New pay offer expected in Scottish teacher strikes,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-64609550,"A new pay offer to try to resolve Scotland's teacher strikes is expected to be made next week.Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, said any new offer would need to be significantly improved before the action is called off.Unions want a 10% rise but the current deal is worth between 5% and 6.85% for most staff.Teachers have held a number of strikes across Scotland since November and more dates are planned for later this month.Council leaders expect to hear on Monday whether the Scottish government will give them money to increase the existing pay offer.If this happens, they will hold a meeting later in the week to agree a new deal before it is presented to unions.The pay dispute centres on the pay rise which teachers were due to receive in April last year.Any offer has to be affordable to all 32 of Scotland's councils.Their hope would be that the new offer would lead to a suspension of strike action while a two year pay deal - which would also cover the 2023 pay offer - was negotiated.The most recent pay offer was made before the first strike by the EIS in November last year. Since then the EIS and other unions have staged a series of walk-outs.Nearly all pupils in Scotland have lost three or four days' worth of education.The next national strike is due on 28 February and 1 March.The EIS is also planning targeted strikes at schools in a number of areas - including the Glasgow constituency of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Education Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said: ""We are committed to resolving this dispute as soon as possible and are progressing work for an improved offer to be put to teaching unions.""There are signs of movement towards a new pay offer for teachers. The signs are tentative. There's no word on what the new offer may be like, far less whether it might be good enough to lead to strikes being suspended.The unions have no knowledge of what may be in the new offer. But the mood music is interesting.It appears that there is now an acceptance on the part of councils and the Scottish government that a new offer will need to be made if the dispute is to be resolved.The details of any new offer would need to be agreed by councils.  How much the new offer is worth will ultimately depend on how much more money the government may make available.All through the dispute, the government has argued that more money for teachers' pay would mean more cuts and savings elsewhere.

They needed a hero.Trailing 26-10 to Scotland with half an hour to play in Rome, the beleaguered Azzurri turned to a somewhat lightweight and youthful looking full-back, plucked from the second tier of French rugby.Eight months later, Ange Capuozzo was named World Rugby's breakthrough player of the year.Born in France and progressing through the ranks at his hometown club Grenoble, initially as a scrum-half, Capuozzo was overlooked by Les Bleus at age-group level.Italy would not make the same mistake.Eligible to play for the Azzurri through his Italian parents, the fleet-footed Capuozzo represented the country's junior teams before stepping off the bench to make a remarkable senior debut in the penultimate game of last year's Six Nations.Two tries in 17 second-half minutes in the defeat by Scotland were followed by a stunning solo run to carve out Edoardo Padovani's last-gasp try in a precious win over Wales in Cardiff to end a 36-game losing streak in the competition.Victory was not enough to halt Italy's miserable run of seven Wooden Spoons but Wales winger Josh Adams presented his man-of-the-match medal to Capuozzo in admiration of his performance - and a star had been born.At 5ft 8in (1.77m) and weighing 12st 9lbs (82kg), Capuozzo's physical make-up is not what you would expect at the highest level. The world has seen shorter players thrill crowds before with the likes of Wales' Shane Williams and South Africa's Cheslin Kolbe - but both men had stockier builds than the slender Capuozzo.The 23-year-old was described as ""paper thin"" by former Ireland centre Brian O'Driscoll on ITV last week - but do not be fooled by the curly hair and the boyish charm, for what he may lack in stature, he offsets with his devastating speed and dazzling footwork.Capuozzo arrived at international level from relative obscurity, but his performances led to a move from Grenoble to five-time Heineken Champions Cup winners and European giants Toulouse last summer.With six Test tries in eight appearances, Capuozzo's exciting international career is still in its infancy but he is well on the way to filling the void left by the colossus Sergio Parisse as Italian rugby's new poster boy.""He is so agile and quick off the mark,"" Italy scrum-half Stephen Varney told BBC Sport.""He has been great for us when he has space, breaking the line and beating that first tackle. It just shows you can be any size to play rugby.""Having pierced a couple of holes in the Australia defence during Italy's first ever win over the Wallabies in the autumn, Capuozzo sniped over with an excellent finish in the Azzurri's narrow opening-round defeat by champions France on Sunday.Welsh-born Varney, 21, recalls his team-mate demanding the ball in the build-up.""He can see the space,"" said Gloucester's Varney. ""He saw Antoine Dupont shoo the other way which left a 10-metre gap so he was screaming for the ball. I gave it early and he did the rest.""With all of his new-found fame and adulation, Capuozzo remains grounded and still has a passion for computer games.It means he is as elusive off the field as on it, says Varney.""He is a class bloke. He loves gaming and plays a bit of Fifa and Call of Duty, so we barely see him as he is always locked away in his room on his portable gaming device,"" joked Varney. ""I played Fifa against him on the train on the way down to Verona from Rome and he is decent to be fair.""This young Italy side may not have an elder statesmen like Parisse - who retired from international rugby in 2019 - or Martin Castrogiovanni, but they have a togetherness and courage to play which may have been missing in previous years.With an average age of 26, Italy are brimming with youthful exuberance - something head coach Kieran Crowley is clearly keen to tap into.The New Zealander wants them to play an exciting brand of rugby with ball in hand and not be shackled by fear of defeat or making mistakes. That plan will not change against a wounded England side looking for an emphatic first win of Steve Borthwick's tenure at Twickenham on Sunday.Varney added: ""With Kieran coming in, he has brought a new playing style which suits the players we have. ""It's been a really good year for us and hopefully we get a few wins now in the Six Nations."" Asked what Crowley has instilled in the players, Varney said: ""Just to be courageous. We want to play from everywhere, as you saw against France. ""People say it's 'suicide rugby' but we see that as an insult because we are trying to play that kind of game. We got close against France and we are up for the challenge against England."""
425,Six Nations: Andy Farrell 'unbelievably proud' as Ireland win France classic,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64610312,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Irish RugbyAndy Farrell hailed Ireland's display as ""astonishing"" as they beat France 32-19 in the Six Nations battle of the world's top two ranked teams in Dublin.Ireland's success in the Aviva Stadium classic was their record 13th straight home win as they ended the 2022 Grand Slam champions' 14-game winning streak.""We'll look at that performance and be unbelievably proud of it,"" the Ireland coach told ITV Sport.""The fight and the spirit that we had was astonishing at times.""The Ireland coach's beaming smile at full-time said it all as nearby his skipper Johnny Sexton - who had come off after 48 minutes following a knock - embraced his young children when the final whistle was blown by referee Wayne Barnes.In times past Ireland would have been nervous after losing Sexton so early in a game of such magnitude, where the home side were aiming to end a run of three straight defeats by Les Bleus.But echoing the coolness with which he slotted the late winning penalty over Australia in November, replacement fly-half Ross Byrne was a composed presence following his introduction, with his five kicked points helping to subdue Fabien Galthie's side. Farrell said Ireland's resolve in closing out the game with Garry Ringrose's bonus-clinching try in the 72nd minute summed up his side's efforts, as the coming World Cup hosts left Dublin with nothing more than further confirmation that the Irish will be genuine contenders in September.Ringrose's score, as he brushed past Matthieu Jalibert's weak tackle, came after first-half tries from Hugo Keenan, James Lowe and Andrew Porter.Replays suggested Lowe's spectacular finish should have been chalked off for his right foot brushing the Aviva Stadium turf.But France also benefited from a questionable decision, with prop Uini Atonio lucky to only be yellow carded for a first-half high hit which forced off hooker Rob Herring for a head injury assessment from which he did not return.""Garry Ringrose's try‚Ä¶..he was dead on his feet, and then Bundee Aki coming back and dropping on loose balls. James Ryan kept getting up off the floor and kept taking the ball on for us,"" added Farrell.""There are lads that have not played for some time so I could keep going on and on.""Aki was among the Ireland replacements who made a big impact, in contrast to France's bench.Replacement prop Tom O'Toole - who is by no means a regular starter for Ulster - was arguably even more influential as he produced a number of superb carries which had the increasingly tired visitors backpedalling.His Ulster team-mate Iain Henderson also showed his continuing worth to the Ireland squad by impressing after coming on for Tadhg Beirne.Munster's Beirne produced a typically industrious display before having to be helped off after 45 minutes although he, like everyone else, was outshone by number eight Caelan Doris, whose breakdown work was a constant irritant to the French.The second half proved a more attritional affair after a breathless opening 40 minutes likely to live long in the memory of everyone who watched.Prop Finlay Bealham's clever pass to a charging Keenan resulted in the France defence parting like the Red Sea for the opening try and after Damian Penaud's sensational reply the Irish hit back to lead 22-16 at the break as Lowe's contentious score was followed by Porter's close-range finish.Ever the perfectionist, Farrell felt his side's advantage at the break should have been greater.Porter and Conor Murray were held up over the France line by Cyril Baille and an incredible Antoine Dupont tackle prevented Mack Hansen from notching a seemingly certain score.""That's not being greedy because we got a bonus point so we've got to be very happy with that but at the same time, we left a few things out there,"" added the Ireland coach.""They are a world-class side [but] playing here at the Aviva we expect to be ourselves and go out there and perform and win.""Skipper Sexton revealed that Ireland and British & Irish Lions great Brian O'Driscoll had spent time with the squad in the build-up to Saturday's game.""We had a very special week and a special build-up to the game with a few special guests [including O'Driscoll] in during the week and spoke about Ireland's call,"" Sexton told BBC Radio Ulster.""It was very emotional and unless you were in the room on Monday night you wouldn't understand why.""After coming close against France at the Stade de France 12 months ago following previous defeats in 2020 and 2021, Sexton said that the Irish had given a ""true account of ourselves"" in Saturday's game.""If everything goes to plan and we get through our group there is a chance we get them again in the World Cup,"" said the 37-year-old.""So it was good to get that off our back in terms of beating them as they were the only team we hadn't beaten."""
426,Premiership Rugby Cup: Exeter Chiefs 46-3 Sale Sharks - hosts cruise into final,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64602729,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Rugby UnionExeter Chiefs will face London Irish in the Premiership Rugby Cup final after cruising past Sale Sharks at Sandy Park in their semi-final.Three tries in eight minutes from Santiago Grondona, Sean O'Brien and Rus Tuima put Exeter 24-3 up at the break.Iwan Jenkins had earlier levelled with a penalty after Sale's Tom Curtis opened the scoring.Further tries in the second half from Tom Wyatt, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Dan Frost tries completed a handsome win.Exeter will face Irish at their Gtech Community Stadium home in the final on Sunday, 19 March.While beaten heavily, Sale's attention quickly turns back to their league ambitions with the side second in the Premiership table.Exeter, led by skills coach Ricky Pellow, handed 31-year-old forward Mike Williams his debut and started with Argentina international Grondona at number eight in a largely youthful side that included Welsh teenager Jenkins at fly-half.Sale's academy coach Gareth Harris has guided Sharks through the competition, and similarly mixed emerging talent with experience. Scrum-half Will Cliff, 34, was called on for the first time in over a year, while teenage flankers Will Riley and Tristan Woodman made their first starts.Curtis kicked the first points of the game after Chiefs full-back Tom Wyatt was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on.Despite being a man down, Exeter levelled soon after through a Jenkins penalty.Grondona gave the hosts the lead for the first time, bursting through a gap after a quick tap penalty to cross for the opening try.O'Brien's score moments later, following an excellent break and offload from Wyatt, stunned Sale further before Tuima crashed over from a maul to help Exeter into a 21-point half-time lead.Cliff's yellow card for a deliberate knock-on left Sale exposed early in the second half.And Wyatt was quick to punish them, stepping beyond two attempted tackles before reaching over to score.The excellent Feyi-Waboso was even more evasive as he blazed down the right wing for their fifth try in the 68th minute, and there was still time for Frost to put the seal on a comprehensive win. Exeter Chiefs: Wyatt; Feyi-Waboso, O'Brien, Hendrickson, O'Loughlin; Jenkins, Cairns; Southworth, Innard, Schickerling; Williams, Pearson, Tuima, Davis, Grondona.Replacements: Frost, Kenny, Iosefa-Scott, Bailey, Leatherbarrow, James, Whitten, Cordero.Sale Sharks: Woodward; McGuigan, James, Hill, Gourlay; Curtis, Cliff; Onasanya, Taylor, Oosthuizen; Birch, Groves, Riley, Woodman, Dugdale.Replacements: Thompson, Carlile, Ford, Murphy, Nkonge, Wootton, Wilkinson, Bedlow.Referee: Hamish Smales."

Jodie Rettie's two tries and one from Alex Ellis finished off a clinical performance.Bristol Bears earned a bonus point as they beat west country rivals Worcester Warriors 38-26.Lark Davies, Ella Lovibond, Gwenllian Pyrs and Grace Crompton all scored for Bristol with Worcester only able to reply twice for a 31-14 scoreline at half-time.Claire Molloy was first to strike in the second half and, despite Worcester scoring twice, including a try from Natalia John, it was not enough to pull off the comeback.Elsewhere, DMP Sharks secured their first win of the season with a 30-5 victory over Wasps."

429,"Six Nations 2023: England v Italy match preview, team news & key stats",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64575052,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Rugby UnionIn any other Six Nations, Italy would be handpicked opposition for England to get over their defeat by Scotland.However, the Azzurri are no longer the sacrificial fodder of previous years and Sunday's fixture at Twickenham is a far more challenging proposition. Italy's thrilling brand of rugby nearly helped them beat defending champions France in week one.Steve Borthwick has rejigged his side's attack as he seeks a first win since becoming England head coach.The omens are good based on previous encounters with Italy - England have won all 29 matches and came away from Rome last year without conceding any points in a 33-0 victory.Borthwick has chosen Owen Farrell instead of Marcus Smith to start at fly-half. Borthwick has decided to move his captain from inside centre, with Smith dropping to the bench, meaning Ollie Lawrence partners Henry Slade in a new-look centre partnership. Jack Willis comes in at number seven in place of Ben Curry, while exciting wing Henry Arundell takes Anthony Watson's position among the replacements.Italy welcome Edoardo Padovani back into the starting line-up for the first time since his try ended their 36-game losing run on the final day of last year's tournament. He takes the place of Pierre Bruno at full-back, who drops to the bench.Prop Marco Riccioni will make his first start since November 2021 in place of Simone Ferrari.Sara Orchard: A break from the intense focus on the Smith-Farrell axis had to come. While England's issues are more than one combination, Steve Borthwick was very clear that his teams are selected for the game. With that in mind Italy can expect some hard running over the gainline from Ollie Lawrence who has been busting holes like this for Bath all season. And despite a lot of talk about how England will attack, a focus on defence will be key after some gaping holes against the Scots last week. Also, if ever England needed a good news story, a big performance from Jack Willis on the open-side, after yet another turbulent season for the back-rower, should warm any cold rugby heart.England head coach Steve Borthwick: ""We are at the start of what is a completely new cycle. The implementation of new systems does take time.""I have selected a team that I believe is best placed to meet the specific challenges that Italy will bring. It is a selection of players whose form, individual strengths and combined qualities suit the way we want to play against Italy.""Italy head coach Kieran Crowley: ""I think they will be a lot more direct and unified.""When a new coach comes in it takes a little bit of time. But they've had three weeks now so I expect that defence will be a lot more solid.""They'll come at us direct and try to exert themselves on us from a physical presence point of view. So we have to beat that and attempt to be accurate in what we do and put the pressure back on them.""England: 15-Steward; 14-Malins, 13-Slade, 12-Lawrence, 11-Hassell-Collins; 10-Farrell (capt); 9-Van Poortvliet; 1-Genge, 2-George, 3-Sinckler, 4-Itoje; 5-Ollie Chessum, 6-Ludlam, 7-Willis, 8-DombrandtReplacements: 16-Walker, 17-M Vunipola, 18-Cole, 19-Isiekwe, 20-Earl, 21-Mitchell, 22-Smith, 23-ArundellItaly: 15-Capuozzo; 14-Padovani, 13-Brex, 12-Morisi, 11-Menoncello; 10-Allan, 9-Varney; 1-Fischetti, 2-Nicotera, 3-Riccioni, 4-Cannone, 5-Ruzza, 6-Negri, 7-Lamaro (capt), 8-CannoneReplacements: 16-Bigi, 17-Zani, 18-Ferrari, 19-Iachizzi, 20-Polledri, 21-Zuliani, 22-Fusco, 23-BrunoHead-to-head  EnglandItalyReferee: James Doleman (NZL)Touch judges: Mathieu Raynal (FRA) and Tual Trainini (FRA) TMO: Eric Gauzins (FRA)"

They have also never defeated Wales with head coach Warren Gatland at the helm in all 10 Six Nations meetings.Wales must win to keep their tournament alive after losing 34-10 to Ireland. Gatland has responded to his side's defeat - Wales' heaviest at home in the Six Nations since 2001 - by overhauling his forward pack and dropping veteran British and Irish Lions trio Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric and Taulupe Faletau.Wales make five changes, with Christ Tshiunza awarded his Six Nations debut alongside Tommy Reffell in the back row, while Jac Morgan moves from six to eight. Wyn Jones comes in for Gareth Thomas and Dillon Lewis replaces the injured Tomas Francis, with Dafydd Jenkins starting in the second row. Rhys Davies is set for his Wales debut having been preferred to Ospreys team-mate Alun Wyn on the Welsh bench, although Faletau has been retained among the replacements.  Scotland are riding high after winning back-to-back matches at Twickenham for the first time in their history to retain the Calcutta Cup and head coach Gregor Townsend has made just one change to his starting XV. Zander Fagerson, who has not played since early December due to a hamstring injury, replaces WP Nel in the front row after missing out against England.Nel drops to the bench in an otherwise unchanged squad.Andrew Cotter: ""To understand where both these sides are, you only have to look at the team selections.

Warren Gatland's perfect record against Scotland has never been under greater threat.""Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend: ""We actually delayed the [internal] team announcement because we had a few selections that we had to sleep on. I believe they've earned the right to get a second opportunity to build on that win against England but the performance wasn't at our best level.""We've got players on the bench and out of the 23 who are quality players that have played very well for us in the past or are itching for that opportunity, so it wasn't an easy decision, but these guys now have the opportunity to build on last week.""Wales head coach Warren Gatland on dropping Alun Wyn Jones and Justin Tipuric: ""We still want to do well in this tournament and Saturday's game is important for us, but we need to think long-term as well in the next seven or eight months.""We have got a huge disparity between those experienced players with the number of caps they've got, and a lot of incredibly talented youngsters with a limited number of caps.

The Exiles saw a second Cinti score ruled out for a forward pass, but with the hosts playing advantage, Jennings kicked the penalty for a narrow but deserved lead with the last play of the first half.Irish quickly opened up a two-score lead after the restart when Basham slammed over from close-range.Yet the seesaw pattern continued as Saints fly-half Grayson, featuring for the first time since October after a foot injury, struck back-to-back penalties to set up a tense final quarter.The Exiles' dominance in the scrum eventually began to tell, and after Poolman won the turnover penalty which allowed Jennings to make it 23-18 with nine minutes left, the Australian centre then slid over for the killer score, fed by Matt Cornish.London Irish assistant coach Declan Danaher told BBC Radio London:""We spoke about bringing a focus to what we were doing in terms of the way we wanted to attack and then real intent in defence, and I think we did that.""They kept pinning pressure back on us and I thought the bench coming on made a big difference.""We've been calm all week, and, like I said, we asked for focus and intent, and on the back of that we knew we could get a performance that would take us to the final.""It's brilliant - I can't wait. It's St Patrick's Day weekend, it's going to be a great atmosphere and it'll be a great way to finish off the weekend.""Northampton Saints coach Matt Ferguson told BBC Radio Northampton:""I thought they were strong all over really.

436,England 31-14 Italy: Jack Willis enjoys 'emotional' return after rollercoaster two years,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/64619725,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section Rugby UnionJack Willis put a turbulent two years behind him to produce a stellar display on his first England start since making his Test debut in November 2020.The flanker has recovered from career-threatening knee injuries and the collapse of boyhood club Wasps to return to the international stage.Willis, 26, scored the opening try and made 20 tackles in England's 31-14 Six Nations win over Italy.""Emotion took over a little bit after the try,"" said Willis.""I feel incredibly lucky to be part of this group and hopefully I'll get another shot in the next few weeks.""Willis' international career has suffered setback after setback. A knee ligament injury forced him to withdraw from England's squad for their tour of South Africa in 2018.He eventually made his Test debut against Georgia in November 2020, before needing surgery on a medial collateral ligament four months later after an injury against Italy in Rome in February 2021.After a long rehabilitation, Willis was back playing for Wasps and returned to the England set-up as a replacement in the victorious tour of Australia last summer under Eddie Jones.Wasps folded at the start of this season and he needed to find another club, joining French and European giants Toulouse last November.With Tom Curry still injured and twin Ben discarded, Willis was rewarded for his club form with his seventh international cap.""I was thinking before the game about [the situation] two years ago,"" said Willis.""It was pretty much two years to this week that I did my knee here against Italy, so it was a little bit emotional leading up to the game.""I thought about how grateful I am to put the shirt on again, and be out here, after everything that happened with Wasps as well. ""It was devastating, what happened at Wasps. I don't think I'll ever get over that. That will be a scar I hold forever.""England head coach Steve Borthwick said he was really pleased with Willis' contribution, which lasted 52 minutes before he was replaced by Ben Earl.""I have been really impressed with him from the first moment I have taken this role - and how desperate he is to play for England,"" he said.Willis' euphoric celebration said it all.Another player who shone was inside centre Ollie Lawrence.With Sale centre Manu Tuilagi now seemingly out of Borthwick's immediate planning, Lawrence was named at 12 in a fresh midfield.Owen Farrell made an underwhelming return to fly-half from playing at inside centre against Scotland last week, but Lawrence made 80 metres in 10 carries and ran over Tommaso Allan for one of England's rare line breaks in the second half.""He has been in tremendous form in the Premiership and in European rugby,"" said Borthwick. ""He has earned his selection and I asked him to play as he does week in week out for Bath and I think he did that.""He did the job the team needed him to.""England got the job done comfortably in the end, despite being far from their fluid best against an improving Azzurri side.Borthwick said his side has moved forward after earning him a first win of his tenure.""There were some small positive steps forward,"" said the former lock.""Credit to the players for working really hard to make those improvements. We are trying to rebuild this team. We left some chances out there. ""Our ruck speed could have been better. When it went up, we stretched the defence more. We have to make sure we are consistent in that regard. ""We conceded some opportunities to the opposition in the late stages of the game again. ""We will have a good look at why, as that is two weeks running now. We were in a winning position late on last week and let it slip so we will make sure we are better in the next game."""

""The last few years have been a journey for this team and we are still young,"" Murray told BBC Sport NI.""This will be a good test for us to see where we are at and hopefully we can put on a good show. I've always wanted to represent Ireland in a World Cup.""Murray juggles her cricket playing and training commitments with completing a degree in Sports Studies at the University of Ulster, but over the next few weeks she will be fully focused on helping Ireland perform well at the World Cup.Following a shock win over Australia in an official warm-up that came after a defeat by Sri Lanka, Ireland face a tough opening group fixture in the tournament itself against England on 13 February, then games against Pakistan, the West Indies and India.""The warm-up games will be quite key in terms of getting used to the grounds we are going to be playing at and our opposition will be world class so we can try out the plans we have in a game situation,"" explained Cara.""I'm immensely proud to be part of a squad competing in a World Cup and I know the work that has gone on behind the scenes to qualify.""To be part of that was incredible and to be here is something each and every one of us is proud of.""To play on the world stage in front of television cameras and have the chance to show what we can do.""Television gives the sport exposure and helps inspire that next generation. Growing up we didn't really have that. Hopefully it will encourage more people at home to come and watch us too.""Ireland claimed their first series victory overseas when they defeated Pakistan 2-1 in a T20 series in November, a success that has served to instil further belief into the squad.""We've grown in confidence over the last 18 months and had that big series win in Pakistan that no-one thought was going to happen,"" said Murray.""The team has gone from strength to strength and we are very excited to see what can happen on the world stage.""A win over Pakistan on their home turf was massive. They are ranked higher than us and to come off a tough series of ODIs [which Pakistan won 3-0] and then win that T20 series 2-1 shows the resilience this team has.""These World Cup games are going to be tough but this squad is more than ready to take them on, very capable. We want to test ourselves against the world's very best.""On any given day we can beat anyone and every time we step out on to that pitch we're going out to win."""
440,Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup 2023: Australia thrash New Zealand by 97 runs in Paarl,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64612023,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section Cricketcomments98Australia made an ominous start to their Women's T20 World Cup campaign by thrashing New Zealand by 97 runs.After setting an imposing target of 174, the two-time defending champions bowled out the White Ferns for 76.Megan Schutt dismissed Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine for golden ducks in the first over before spinner Ashleigh Gardner took 5-12.Opener Alyssa Healy hit 55, captain Meg Lanning a majestic 41 and Ellyse Perry 40 in Australia's 173-9.The world-class trio laid a platform, meaning Australia still reached their large total despite losing 5-19 in the closing overs.They leap straight to the top of the Group A standings, above Sri Lanka who beat hosts South Africa on Friday.The huge margin of New Zealand's defeat severely dents their hopes and boosts the chances of the Proteas, given the damage inflicted on the White Ferns' net run-rate which will separate teams who finish level on points.England began their tournament with an impressive seven-wicket win over West Indies earlier on Saturday.Australia have won five of the last six editions of this competition and, having won the Ashes, the 50-over World Cup and Commonwealth Games in 2022, have become one of the dominant teams in world sport.They suffered a shock loss to Ireland in a warm-up game earlier this week but the emphatic margin of this victory squashed any thought that they are anything but huge favourites in South Africa.Their batting line-up is fearsome. Their bowling is high-class and varied.Megan Schutt began with five wides but bowled Suzie Bates, who tried an ambitious scoop off her stumps, a ball later and then trapped Devine lbw. That all but ended the contest and afterwards a ruthless showing from all seven bowlers used followed, Gardner stealing the headlines with her accurate off-spin and her first international five-wicket haul.With the bat, Australia lost opener Beth Mooney to a stunning leaping catch by Eden Carson in the first over but afterwards Healy and Lanning found the boundaries at will in a dominant stand of 70 from 54 balls.Lanning was bowled by a googly from Kerr but Perry took on the scoring, hitting two sixes in her imperious 22-ball knock.The worry for the rest of the competition is Australia's batting has room for improvement. They looked on course for an even bigger total at 148-4 after 16.2 overs before a slide of wickets which included a sloppy run-out and a succession of catches offered to deep fielders by the lower middle order.""Someone is going to have play very well to beat Australia,"" former England spinner Alex Hartley said.""They did show slight weaknesses today. They should have got up about 180-190, and could have got 200 at one stage.""But we are clutching at straws. They are a very strong side.""Australia captain Meg Lanning: ""Healy and Perry were incredible to put New Zealand under pressure. We are really happy with our performance.""New Zealand captain Sophie Devine: ""To put it bluntly we were really poor today in all facets of the game. I thought Australia batted particularly well. It is really disappointing.""Player of the match Ashleigh Gardner: ""That was set up by our batters and that gave us flexibility and freedom with the ball. We've started exactly in the way we wanted too and I was just lucky enough to take the wickets at the end.""These comments are now closed."
441,SA20 final: Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat Pretoria Capitals to win inaugural competition,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64617952,"Last updated on 12 February 202312 February 2023.From the section CricketAdam Rossington's half-century helped Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat Pretoria Capitals by four wickets in the inaugural SA20 final in Johannesburg. The Capitals, including England pair Phil Salt and Adil Rashid, struggled to 135 all out on a slow pitch.Englishman Rossington opened the Sunrisers' reply with 57 from 30 balls to put them ahead of the run rate.And while the chase faltered, Aiden Markram's side reached their target with 22 balls to spare.The final was pushed back from Saturday after heavy rain led to a waterlogged pitch and, unsurprisingly, Sunrisers skipper Markram chose to field after winning the toss.Sunrisers' slow left-armer Roelof van der Merwe, the tournament's leading wicket-taker, made full use of the pitch to take 4-31, including the key wicket of opener Salt for eight.Rossington then took centre stage, scoring nine boundaries, including five sixes, to take the game away from the Capitals.He led his side to 103-2 before being caught behind in the 11th over off Anrich Nortje, who finished with 2-21.The Sunrisers' chase slowed as wickets began to fall, but 22-year-old South Africa batsman Marco Jansen eventually got them over the line with a driven six.Sunrisers coach Adrin Birrell, who also led Hampshire to the T20 Blast title last year, paid tribute to Rossington's ""exceptional"" knock, saying: ""What can I say about Ross? He showed he only needs 30 balls and he can win you the match.""England white-ball captain Jos Buttler was named the SA20's top batter after scoring 391 runs for Paarl Royals."
442,ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2023: Sri Lanka shock hosts South Africa in World Cup opener,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64593957,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section CricketAn inspired bowling performance from Sri Lanka produced a shock win over hosts South Africa in the opening match of the Women's T20 World Cup in Cape Town.In a tense finish, South Africa needed 13 to win from the final over in pursuit of 130 for victory, but buckled under the pressure to fall three runs short.Spinner Inoka Ranaweera took 3-18 as a packed Newlands crowd was silenced.Sri Lanka's first-innings total of 129-4 was set up by captain Chamari Atapattu's 68 from 49 balls and 17-year-old Vishmi Gunaratne's supporting 35.Sri Lanka started slowly, reaching just 28 after the powerplay after a fearsome opening spell from quicks Marizanne Kapp and Shabnim Ismail, but Atapattu and Vishmi added 86 for the second wicket - Sri Lanka's highest partnership for any wicket in T20s against South Africa.It still seemed a below-par total but Sri Lanka, who have not played an international match since October, used the conditions to their advantage with their spinners taking seven of the eight wickets to fall on a slow pitch with big boundaries. The momentum shifted throughout South Africa's chase, with captain Sune Luus looking to steer her side to victory before she was crucially stumped for 28 in the 19th over. But for South Africa, the impact of the defeat in front of a home crowd was evident as the last-wicket pair of Ayabonga Khaka and Nonkululeko Mlaba sunk to their knees in dismay. Sri Lanka will be hoping for consecutive victories when they take on Bangladesh on Sunday, while South Africa will be aiming to bounce back in a key encounter against New Zealand on Monday.South Africa's World Cup preparation was shrouded in controversy and debate when the selectors dropped their captain and star all-rounder Dane van Niekerk for not meeting the standard time for a two-kilometre run. They would have been desperate to silence the noise with an opening win, thereby proving there may not have been any need for controversy at all. Instead, the debate has just got louder. But South Africa - and the rest of the competition - will be hoping the result does not deter the crowd, who turned up in their thousands and lit up Newlands with song, colour, dance and joy throughout the entire match, even when it went against their team. Ismail's first ball was greeted with an exhilarating roar, the grass banks packed with schoolchildren erupted when Nadine de Klerk took the first wicket, and every boundary in the chase was cheered like a winning moment. There was plenty to be optimistic about off the field, but on it, there is one statistic that many will not want to read.The most runs scored in South Africa in successful T20 run chases have come from three batters who could have been out there, but were not: Lizelle Lee, Van Niekerk and Mignon du Preez.South Africa captain Sune Luus on BBC Test Match Special: ""First of all, thank you to the crowd, I hope you keep coming back and enjoying women's cricket.""Sri Lanka had a good partnership and we lacked that in our batting innings. I thought chasing 130 was a par score and that 140-150 would have been a good score on that pitch. I don't think Sri Lanka ran away with the game.""One game doesn't define us. The World Cup has a long way to go. Marizanne Kapp and Shabnim Ismail were exceptional today and there are lots of positives going into the next games.""Sri Lanka captain Chamari Atapattu on BBC Test Match Special: ""The wicket was really good for batting. I would definitely have batted first. ""We have shocked big teams before and we have done it again. We want to get to the semi-finals. I hope we can get there because it is my eighth World Cup and I haven't been there yet so I want to be there with my team.""I really liked that the crowd supported both teams. That is a really good thing for women's cricket."""

It is the women's version of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world's biggest T20 franchise competition.The five franchises have been sold for ¬£465m, with one each in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Lucknow.Here's everything you need to know about the tournament, before Monday's player draft.The WPL will begin on 4 March, six days after the Women's T20 World Cup ends in South Africa. It runs until 24 March, a week before the IPL starts.The matches will all be held in Mumbai, at the 20,000-seater Brabourne Stadium and the much larger DY Patil Stadium (60,000 capacity). There are five teams: UP Warriorz, Gujarat Giants, Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai. The format is simple - every team plays the other four twice, with the top three from this stage qualifying for the play-off stage.The table toppers will reach the final automatically, with second and third place competing in an eliminator.The Indian cricket board (BCCI) received 1,525 applications from players wanting to play in the tournament, from which 246 Indians and 163 overseas players made the final cut.There are a maximum of 90 slots available across the five teams, with 30 places reserved for overseas players - six per franchise.Each team has almost ¬£1.2m to spend on between 15 and 18 players at the auction, which is being held on 13 February (from approx. 09:00 GMT).The BCCI set a base price of ¬£30,000, ¬£39,000 and ¬£50,000 for capped international cricketers to pick from when they registered themselves for the auction. The highest salary in the women's Hundred is ¬£31,250.WPL teams must sign a minimum of 15 players, and can have a maximum of 18.

446,New Zealand v England: Stuart Broad says missing West Indies tour saved his career,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64593677,"Last updated on 11 February 202311 February 2023.From the section CricketStuart Broad believes being left out of England's tour of West Indies last year saved his Test career.Broad and long-time new-ball partner James Anderson were omitted for a series played on dead pitches which England lost 1-0.After he and Anderson were recalled, Broad was England's leading wicket-taker in the home summer.""I don't think it was designed like that by the selectors but I count myself as pretty lucky,"" said Broad.Speaking before England's two-Test series against New Zealand gets under way in Mount Maunganui on Thursday (01:00 GMT), Broad added: ""If I had gone there on those pitches I'm not sure I'd be here now. Arguably that decision saved my career.""Looking back a year I would not have chosen to miss the Caribbean but it was a good thing that has happened for me.""Broad and Anderson were left out almost exactly a year ago in the aftermath of the 4-0 Ashes defeat in Australia, which saw coach Chris Silverwood and director of cricket Ashley Giles sacked.A revamped squad was chosen for West Indies as part of interim managing director Andrew Strauss' ""red-ball reset"", but the loss in the Caribbean extended England's run of poor form to one win in 17 Tests and prompted Joe Root's resignation as captain.New director of cricket Rob Key installed Ben Stokes as skipper and Brendon McCullum as coach, sparking a spectacular revival that has seen England win nine of their past 10 Tests.In that time, no bowler in the world has more wickets than 40-year-old Anderson, while Broad would be higher than fourth on that list if he had not missed the tour of Pakistan in December following the birth of his daughter Annabella.Despite not featuring in England's historic 3-0 series win, Broad feels like he deserves to reclaim his place for day-night series opener against the Black Caps.""I was the leading wicket-taker in the summer and if I'd have gone on the two tours I missed I would have ended up the leading wicket-taker in the world last year,"" Broad told BBC Sport.""I'm doing a role that's asked of me from Baz and Stokesy and I've been a part of a lot of winning Test matches in the past year.""At the age of 36, Broad would not be drawn on his long-term future, saying it is ""tiring to look too far ahead"", but he does not think the trip to New Zealand will be his final tour as an England player.And, after a 159-match career in which he has taken 566 wickets, the Nottinghamshire man said he is finding playing for England ""addictive"" because of the swashbuckling style championed by Stokes and McCullum.""You just don't know what's going to happen,"" said Broad. ""You're drawn to it. You want to watch it.""There are times we have to soak up pressure, but there are times when the guys play with such freedom. ""You don't want to miss one of Joe Root's reverse-scoops or Harry Brook's slap over mid-wicket for six. You want to see it. It's really addictive to be a part of."""
447,'Childcare costs are pricing me out of the job market',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-64597414,"For Alexandra Mesecke, the cost of childcare proved so expensive it effectively priced her out of the job market. As a post-graduate HR manager, she feels frustration at not being able to put her qualifications to full use. Paying for childcare cost her about ¬£900 a month which she said was the equivalent of paying a second mortgage.The government said it has invested over ¬£10.5bn into early education in three years.Ms Mesecke, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said being priced out of the job market to care for her 17-month-old daughter left her feeling like ""women aren't worth it"".""It's like they don't want us at the table. They want us at home cooking and cleaning and looking after the children,"" she said.Senior Conservative MPs have urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to prioritise childcare reforms, arguing it is too expensive for parents.The UK is among the most expensive countries for childcare in the world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.The average cost of full-time nursery for a child aged under two in the UK is about ¬£14,000 a year.Separate research carried out by the Trade Union Congress showed that part-time nursery fees have increased by 44% since 2010 - an increase of over ¬£2,000 a year.The government provides up to 30 hours of free childcare across 38 weeks of the year to parents in England once their child turns three.But for mothers like Vicky Burton, from Burgess Hill, West Sussex, it is not enough.""I currently have two children, one who's ten months and one who's two and neither of them will qualify until they turn three,"" she said.She wants to return to work but has questioned whether it is practically or financially worth it, given the expensive cost of childcare.Ali Tait runs a support group MIB Network Mums In Business in Sevenoaks, Kent.She told BBC Politics South East: ""There's all these people who've been through an education system, often been to university or further education.

The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee wrote to Environment Secretary Therese Coffey asking for an urgent study into the mass die-off.But Ms Coffey has replied that finding the cause was ""highly unlikely"".An expert panel's report previously concluded ""a novel pathogen was the most likely"" cause of the deaths.The chairman of the select committee, Scarborough and Whitby Conservative MP Sir Robert Goodwill, wanted a new study to provide ""as definitive an explanation as possible"" and for various government bodies to monitor the area and carry out ""thorough sampling and testing for chemical pollutants such as pyridine"".But Ms Coffey reiterated the expert panel's report and said: ""Given the extent of the analytical work already undertaken, and further advice, I have decided that it is highly unlikely that we will find the cause.""No further analysis will be undertaken by the government."" The environment secretary said there were already ""sampling and testing protocols - both routine and for emergencies"" in place.She said the Environment Agency was the ""first responder"" and said she had asked the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) to be ""engaged promptly"" if a similar event occurred again.But Ms Coffey said there was ""no question of the government providing any compensation or specific support"", as an existing range of help for the seafood industry was already available.She also rejected concerns about the economic impact of the die-offs, saying stock monitoring suggested the catch in late 2021 was ""broadly"" normal and no ""significant reduction in landings"" had been observed.""This does not preclude the possibility that some highly localised fishing grounds suffered significant mortalities,"" she said.Stock monitoring had found lobster landings in the 2022 season were ""in line with seasonal expectations"", she added.Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Mr Cortes retired as general secretary in October, with Frank Ward taking up the role on an interim basis.In its statement on Friday, the union said that its executive committee had been made aware after the report's publication that Mr Cortes was still being employed by the union.This had not been previously known by the committee, the union said, adding that Mr Cortes was among the five staff members who have now been suspended. The BBC has approached him for comment.In her report, Baroness Kennedy said she had taken evidence from over 50 people and uncovered a ""series of appalling incidents"" within the union.These included incidents of inappropriate and sexual touching, sexual assault, coercive behaviour and the humiliation of staff, she said.Those giving evidence described the culture within the union as ""toxic"", ""sexist"", ""vindictive"" and ""misogynistic"", she wrote.""I also heard evidence of failings in due process, natural justice and governance,"" she added.The TSSA said after the publication of the report on Wednesday, that the president and treasurer of the executive committee had stood down.The Trades Union Congress, an umbrella body for unions, said Baroness Kennedy's report ""must lead to genuine culture change"". Its general secretary Paul Nowak has demanded a meeting with the TSSA to ""discuss next steps""."
453,AstraZeneca: Jeremy Hunt 'disappointed' by drugs firm's low tax move,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64596743,"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said he is ""disappointed"" drugs giant AstraZeneca has chosen the low-tax Republic of Ireland over the UK to build a new ¬£320m factory. The firm's chief executive said it had wanted to build the site in north-west England, but the ""discouraging"" tax rate meant it chose Dublin instead. Mr Hunt said he agreed with the firm's ""fundamental case"" on business taxes. But he said the government would not consider tax cuts funded by borrowing.AstraZeneca is the UK's biggest publicly listed company and has its headquarters in Cambridge. The firm already has sites close to Macclesfield, Cheshire, and had originally wanted to build its new factory nearby. It says the planned Dublin factory is expected to create around 100 skilled jobs. Mr Hunt told the BBC: ""We're disappointed that we lost out this time. And we agree with the fundamental case they're making which is that we need our business taxation to be more competitive and we want to bring business taxes down. ""But the only tax cuts we won't consider are ones that are funded by borrowing because they're not a real tax cut. They're just passing on the bill to future generations.""He added: ""If you look at life sciences, we have billion pound investments announced recently by BioNTech, by Moderna, by Merck, by other big pharmaceutical companies. We think we are in a tremendously strong position, with the biggest Life Science Centre in Europe.'In April corporation tax, which is paid by UK companies and foreign firms with UK offices, is due to increase from 19% to 25%. Dr Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: ""There are more stories about losing investment, like the one we've seen with AstraZeneca, than the positive noise stories coming in, and we really have to turn that around.""AstraZeneca and others in the sector have also expressed concern about the NHS-branded medicines sales levy, which has soared because of rising demand since the Covid pandemic. Dr Torbett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The agreement we have with the NHS, that has got to the point where companies are now paying more than a quarter of their revenues - not profit but revenues - back to the government.""That is vastly in excess of anything the industry pays anywhere else in the world and we have to get to the point where the UK is able to compete for investment on a level playing field, and we are not there yet.""Conservative MP Sir John Redwood said the UK was ""being undercut mercilessly by the Irish tax system"". Sir John is member of the Conservative Growth Group of backbench MPs, calling for a return to ex-PM Liz Truss's tax-cutting agenda. Mr Hunt has warned it is unlikely there will be any room for ""significant"" tax cuts in the Budget in March. It comes as new figures show the UK narrowly avoided falling into recession in 2022, after the economy saw zero growth between October and December. The Bank of England still expects the UK to enter recession this year - usually defined as when the economy shrinks for two consecutive three-moth periods.

454,Laura Kuenssberg: Jets to Ukraine decision 'not easy' says Poland,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64602603,"One of Ukraine's closest allies has cast doubt on whether it would be able to supply President Volodymyr Zelenksy with the fighter jets he says are needed to win the war with Russia. Poland's President, Andrzej Duda - speaking exclusively to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg - said sending F-16 aircraft would be a ""very serious decision"" that was ""not easy to take"". Poland has been one of Ukraine's most vocal supporters since Russia invaded.Last month, it was one of several countries to pledge to send more tanks, ammunition and equipment to the front line.This video can not be playedPoland's President, Andrzej Duda: ""This (sending jets) requires a decision by the allies""President Duda's comments come despite him and President Zelensky having spoken this week - at the end of the Ukrainian leader's surprise headline-grabbing European tour. In London, President Zelensky used his speech in Parliament to call for the means to help fight Russia in the air:""I appeal to you and the world with the simple, and yet most important words - combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom."" Ukraine's leader repeated that call in Paris and Brussels, in a rare departure from his country, under the tightest of security. He made headlines right around the world.In Warsaw, President Duda told me sending F-16 jets would pose a ""serious problem"" because, with fewer than 50 of the aircraft in the Polish air force, ""we have not enough‚Ä¶ and we would need many more of them."" He also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16s, have a ""very serious need for maintenance"" so it's ""not enough just to send a few planes"". With Poland being a Nato member, said Mr Duda, any decision to provide fighter jets had to be a ""joint decision"" - rather than one for any single country to take.There are also nerves about whether providing planes would pull Nato directly into the conflict - and even into war against Russia itself. At the start of the Russian invasion in 2022, Duda said sending jets would ""open a military interference in the Ukrainian conflict"". But - in direct response to Ukraine's request for planes this week - the Polish leader's comments are significant. As Ukraine's neighbour, President Duda has been one of the most ardent supporters of President Zelensky and has contributed vast amounts of military aid, becoming the main supplier of heavy weaponry - including infantry fighting vehicles and artillery, drones and ammunition. Duda was also at the forefront of pushing other allies to promise to provide tanks in recent weeks. After notable reluctance from Germany, and a fraught debate across Europe about the risks of escalating the conflict, Leopard tanks will arrive in Ukraine, along with Challengers from the UK and Abrams from the US. Poland has also provided homes to millions of Ukrainian refugees.President Duda is adamant that ""weaponry has to be delivered to Ukraine all the time‚Ä¶ it needs armaments."" But it is clear he doesn't think sending combat aircraft in large numbers is likely from Poland or any other ally, at least in the short term.The UK also made it clear pretty rapidly that sending planes to Ukraine was not realistic in the immediate future. Yes, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said ""nothing was off the table"" while he savoured his photo opportunity with President Zelensky in front of a tank this week - jeans tucked into unlaced boots, tieless, alongside the Ukrainian leader in his familiar army sweatshirt and combat trousers. But before too long, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was making plain that would mean training for pilots and other support first. No UK jets will take off for Ukraine any time soon.All week, British politicians have been falling over themselves to associate with the biggest political celebrity in the world right now, President Zelenksy, sharing their blurry phone snaps of his historic Westminster Hall speech and giving interviews about how moving it was to be there.In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron greeted him like a film star in front of the Elysee Palace. EU leaders then frantically tweeted pictures of their own ""grip and grin"" moments with the Ukrainian leader later.There is staunch support for President Zelensky without doubt. It's not just shown in flowery language and promises of commitment but, as President Duda explains, with guns, tanks and drones, plus support for refugees, rather than selfies with MPs. Western allies emphasise how countries have come together in a way that will have disappointed and frustrated Vladimir Putin. Leaders, like Poland's president, underline the threat they feel to their own countries. Talking to him in Warsaw about the conflict is a world away from conversations in Westminster, with the Russian border at Kaliningrad only about 200 miles away. The dilemma over jets is another example of the fraught calculations our leaders face. What is practically possible in terms of supporting Ukraine? And what is politically and diplomatically viable, without provoking a wider war?  Poland and other countries' firm backing does not mean the West, or even Ukraine's closest allies, will or can say ""yes"" to his every request. One senior diplomatic source suggests President Zelensky is, of course, well aware of this. His headline-grabbing journey this week was not just about the jets, and it doesn't look like it will soon result in ""wings for freedom"". But - as we approach the anniversary of Russia's invasion - his European tour's careful choreography, and powerful imagery will have reminded not just Western politicians but also their publics, of what is at stake.Follow Laura Kuenssberg on TwitterTruss's tax cuts clearly wrong approach - ShappsKuenssberg: Truss returns - and it could be trouble for PMHave Sunak's first 100 days been calm or 'cringe'?"

457,Ian Lavery: Ex-Labour Party chairman faces questions over tax affairs,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64596751,"Former Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery has denied suggestions that his tax affairs may not have been in order.He told the BBC he had never been investigated by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and had never paid a tax penalty.The MP for Wansbeck added that he ""does not owe a single penny"" in tax. The tax expert and campaigner Dan Neidle believes there are questions to answer over payments Mr Lavery received from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and whether the correct tax had been paid.The i newspaper has published a series of questions which they have sent to Mr Lavery - who was chairman of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - about payments dating back to more than a decade ago. Mr Lavery had received redundancy or termination payments from the NUM when he became a Labour MP in 2010.The union maintained that his post as general secretary of Northumberland NUM was deleted when he became an MP and therefore he was entitled to redundancy or termination payments, in line with his contracts of employment.He received ¬£30,600 in 2010 and a further ¬£30,000 in 2011.When the trade union watchdog, the Certification Officer, looked into the issue in 2017, they said: ""Both the union and Mr Lavery were given the opportunity to provide documentary evidence to show a process or decision by which Mr Lavery was made redundant. Neither was able to do so and stated that no such documentary evidence existed."" However, the officer decided not to pursue the matter further.The i, and Mr Neidle, who helped to uncover details about the tax affairs of Nadhim Zahawi which led to him being sacked as Conservative Party chairman, have now questioned whether the payments genuinely were redundancy payments.The paper suggested that if no redundancy process was undertaken then the entire payment from his union should have been declared to HMRC as income. It asked whether Mr Lavery had done this and if he had paid tax on the sum. Mr Lavery declined to answer the i's question directly but told the paper no additional payments had been requested by HMRC and no penalties had been applied. It is understood that HMRC did seek to clarify in 2017 whether the payments constituted redundancy and has subsequently not taken any action.Mr Lavery, now a backbench MP, told the BBC he believes that personal tax affairs should remain confidential, but he insists that he has never been under investigation by HMRC and that he ""does not owe a single penny"" in tax.He added that it would be ""preposterous"" to draw any parallel between his tax affairs and those of Mr Zahawi. Mr Neidle, a Labour party member, said: ""When there are undocumented payments... it is reasonable to ask whether the correct tax has been paid on the payments.""A Labour spokesman said it was up to Mr Lavery himself to respond to any questions about his tax affairs.

458,Claims 'London clique' selecting Labour general election candidates,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64595772,"The leaders of a local Labour Party have walked out over a ""a clique in London"" they claim are dictating who is selected to stand as an MP.Nine members of Labour's 13 strong Bolton North East executive say they ""lack confidence in the integrity"" of the party's selection process.It comes after a local party figure, Leigh Drennan, was prevented from standing in the seat.Labour Party HQ in London has been contacted for comment.Party bosses have previously said they are ensuring that every candidate they put forward is of a high standard.With a general election expected next year, Labour activists are eager to be selected as candidates in winnable seats. Victory could put them into the House of Commons, and could get the Labour Party into government.Mr Drennan - the chair of the party's regional body Labour North West - had been endorsed by Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner and a number of trade unions affiliated to the party. Despite this, Labour's governing body prevented him running as a candidate in Bolton North East.Conservative Mark Logan won the seat at the 2019 general election by just 378 votes, making it a top Labour target, as the party seeks to rebuild the ""Red Wall"" of traditional strongholds.Bernadette Gallagher, who quit the Bolton North East executive on Friday morning, accused Labour HQ of playing ""a very dirty game"", arguing that three other potential candidates were imposed on the constituency without local input. She added that the selection process had been ""manipulated"" to keep Mr Drennan out and told the BBC she felt that Sir Keir Starmer was trying to restrict his overall pool of candidates to ""moderates"".She claimed the three-person shortlist was decided by a panel from London who ""don't understand the Red Wall seats"". Another executive member who resigned, Francesca Platt, labelled the selection process ""absolute chaos"". She said local officials were not given a say in their candidates and were then expected to be ""fodder"" for delivering leaflets.Charlotte Nichols, Labour MP for nearby Warrington North, tweeted that Mr Drennan's exclusion was ""one of the most blatantly factional examples of abuse of the process I've seen in the 15 years or so I've been a party member"".It is understood Leigh Drennan was blocked due to a ""due diligence"" issue, meaning the party had concerns about letting him proceed as a candidate. But a number of local activists have disputed this.Some close to the selection have suggested that the Labour leadership considered Mr Drennan too left-wing to stand for the party. He had been backed in previous internal elections by Momentum, the campaign group which supported Jeremy Corbyn.In an endorsement on his campaign website, Ms Rayner said Mr Drennan had ""cut his teeth in the trade union movement and this is reflected in his socialist policies"".The first stage in the path to becoming a Labour MP is to get on the longlist of candidates for a seat. This stage of the process is controlled by Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC), the party's ruling body. The longlist is whittled down to a shortlist by local officials before constituency members pick their candidate.Various left-wing candidates have previously claimed they were unfairly blocked from making the longlist.Last month, the president of the National Education Union Louise Atkinson, who is a serving Labour councillor, was not allowed to run in Carlisle. She told the BBC she was given ""no clear reason"" for being excluded.Last year, the entire leadership of the Labour Party in Wakefield resigned over disagreements with party HQ about how the candidate for a by-election was chosen.Labour insist they are simply ensuring their candidates are of the ""highest calibre"". But some in the party feel there is a policy of blocking those who could potentially rebel in the future against Sir Keir more moderate leadership. "

He previously pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.Sentencing him, Judge Peter Lodder KC mentioned Grigg's ""obsession"" with BDSM. The defendant's ex-girlfriend had recounted how he said his police handcuffs ""had come in useful"", the judge said.Earlier, when describing the assault, prosecutor Alexander Agbamu said Grigg had bent Ms Rabinowitz over the sofa before tying her ankles together and taping over her mouth.At one point, a postman rang the doorbell, and Grigg left briefly to answer, before ""smiling"" down at her as she attempted to free herself by edging towards a drawer she believed might contain a knife.""He seemed to enjoy what he was seeing,"" Mr Agbamu said.When Ms Rabinowitz asked him to remove her bindings, Grigg replied: ""If you ask nicely, I'll take them off.""He eventually got a knife from the kitchen and used it to cut the tape, nicking her ankle and wrist in the process.She asked him to avoid cutting her again, and Grigg said: ""What will you do if I do.?... Who are you going to tell? I am the police.""During a search of his bedroom, officers found a bag of cable ties, several pairs of handcuffs, bundles of rope, a gag and ball, and four silk cloths.They also found a DVD with an image of a woman bound with rope and with duct tape over her mouth on the cover.""I genuinely, like 100%, thought he was going to rape me,"" Ms Rabinowitz messaged a friend after the attack.A victim impact statement was read out by Mr Agbamu, who said she had considered harming herself and had experienced a deterioration in her mental health.Speaking after the hearing, Met Police Cmdr Jon Savell described what happened as ""appalling"" and ""a terrifying ordeal"" for Grigg's housemate.He said: ""He's let down the Met and his colleagues who are committed to protecting Londoners.""Grigg was suspended from duty after being charged on 8 December, two days after his arrest, and was dismissed without notice on 30 January.He will spend an extended period of two years on licence after his release.Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

This is beyond dispute.""He added: ""As mayor, I simply won't accept that the five million people in outer London shouldn't be able to benefit from the same life-saving health impacts that ULEZ has already brought to the rest of our city. ""Everyone has the right to breathe clean air.""City Hall said all of London still exceeded the World Health Organization's guidelines for air quality, and more than half of deaths attributable to air pollution were in outer London. It added about 4,000 Londoners died prematurely each year due to toxic air.Eleven outer London councils have expressed concerns over its expansion, with many asking the mayor to delay or improve the scrappage scheme to support people during the cost-of-living crisis.In an open letter to the mayor, Bexley, Bromley, Harrow and Hillingdon said their boroughs ""enjoy good air quality"" with levels of harmful gases ""considerably below the levels in inner and central London"".Some councils bordering London also have objections, with some refusing to allow warning signs and cameras to be placed on their land.BBC London's transport correspondent Tom EdwardsThis isn't really what it seems; it's not really about the ULEZ as it is at the moment, covering the area within the north and south circular, it's all about the planned expansion. That has received heavy flak from many businesses, councils in outer London and the Home Counties. They say the cost of ¬£12.50 a day is too much for the 200,000 non-compliant vehicles that will have to pay, especially during a cost-of-living crisis. They also claim the ULEZ will make only marginal improvements to air quality in outer London. What the mayor is doing here is fighting back and using the data to show ULEZ does improve air quality. He is trying to frame the argument that this is a health issue above all else. Will this data change his political opponents minds? No. But it does draw up the battle lines very clearly.

468,London Bridge: Derelict railway arches restored to past glory,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-64582247,"A derelict set of railway arches that was once home to one of London's finest wine and spirits merchants has been restored as part of a ¬£3m investment.Situated next to London Bridge station, the arches hosted Findlater, Mackie and Todd, a shop first opened in 1863 where it remained for more than a century.In 2018, the arches fell into disrepair after the remaining tenants left.That was until the Arch Company bought the site as part of a ¬£1.5bn property deal with Network Rail.Renovations, which began in 2022, have seen the Edwardian fa√ßade, which was added at the turn of the last century, restored. At the time, the glazed terracotta tiles, known as Carrara ware by Royal Doulton, were described as a ""wonder material of the time"".The project's architect, Benedict O'Looney, said: ""One of the things that was so attractive to architects and designers in the Edwardian period, is that the rain washed the soot off.""

Now a familiar motif within the spirit's industry, it is thought its inclusion above the Findlater, Mackie and Todd shop was one of the first times it was used to promote whiskey.The project team also made a surprise discovery when removing a section of plaster from a wall to another of the arches; a glass mosaic for an Express Dairy Tea Room dating back to the early 1900s. Railway stations were a popular location for tea rooms because at the time they had access to the freshest milk, often transported from farms on trains before being sent to urban milk dairies.""The tea rooms were one of the first places that ladies, who couldn't necessarily go and eat in bars or eat in chop houses, could come, get together as single women and meet their friends, so this is perhaps an important part of the emancipation of urban woman in London"", said Mr O'Looney.The restoration is part of the Arch Company's ""Project 1000"", which will see an investment of ¬£200m into 1,000 derelict railway arches across the UK, bringing them back to commercial use for businesses to rent.The Railway Heritage Trust also contributed ¬£120,000 having campaigned for the past 10 years for Findlater's Corner to be restored.""This was an absolute eyesore beforehand,"" said Andy Savage, chair of the trust.""You would come over London Bridge, you had Findlater's right in front of you and it was totally derelict. ""It's now restored and looking really good, so it's a part of the railway that's in much better condition now.""Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The 28-year-old is due to be put on a Turkey-bound flight from the Netherlands shortly before 12:00 GMT on Friday, the BBC understands.His lawyer Flip Sch√ºller said the situation was ""very, very worrying"".He said his client - whose father is a notorious hate preacher currently serving a whole-life sentence in a US prison for terror offences - is being deported following an agreement made between Turkey and the Netherlands.It is not known what charges, if any, he will face in Turkey and his legal team fear he could be extradited to a third country.""The details of this agreement have not been disclosed to his legal team, nor the wider public,"" Mr Sch√ºller added.""We are very concerned about why the details are being kept confidential. This is very, very worrying.""There are grave concerns about refusal at the border and indirect refoulment (the forcible return of refugees or asylum seekers to a country where they are liable to be subjected to persecution) by Turkey of my client.""Mustafa - also known as Sufean Mostafa Kamal - travelled to Syria when he was 18 in 2013 and stayed in the country for six years fighting against Bashir al Assad's regime.The UK government revoked his British citizenship in 2016 - with Mustafa telling the BBC in 2022 it was because the authorities suspected him of engaging in terrorist activity while in Syria.Mustafa denies taking part in any form of terrorism and insists his role was to help protect the people of Syria. He was detained in Turkey in 2019 and put on a flight to the UK two years later. It transited in Amsterdam, where he was arrested and sent to the Nieuw Vosseveld high-security prison in Vught.A legal case ensued, which led to a deal was struck between Turkey and the Netherlands in August last year, according to his lawyers.They fear that once he lands in Turkey he will be detained and then deported to another country.Mustafa, who was a student in London when he left for Syria, has a wife and two sons living in the capital.A family member, who asked not to named, told the BBC: ""The situation has been increasingly stressful on his family, not knowing where he'll go and what will happen to him. It has caused great distress to his wife and children.""His son repeatedly asks, 'When will we see Daddy again?'.""It's a difficult question for them to deal with.

479,County Championship to trial Kookaburra ball in 2023 as bonus points system re-vamped,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/64603031,"Last updated on 10 February 202310 February 2023.From the section CountiesThe County Championship will see a revamp of the batting points system and the trial use of a Kookaburra ball during the 2023 season.Points for a draw will revert back to five from the eight introduced in 2019, batting points will be awarded from 250 runs, up from the current 200, to a maximum of five for totals of 450.The number of points for a win remains unchanged at 16.The Kookaburra ball will be used in two rounds of games in June and July.The adjustments to the new season have been made following former England captain Sir Andrew Strauss' high-performance review of the men's game, announced in September with the intention of improving the fortunes of the England team.With the Kookaburra ball offering less movement to bowlers, its introduction in place of the more seamer-friendly Dukes ball is designed to level out the contest between bat and ball and prepare England players better for tours to places where use of the Kookaburra is more common such as Australia and South Africa. Two rounds of Championship matches, on 25-28 June and 10-13 July, will pilot its use, with the dates picked deliberately during this summer's Ashes series because all 18 counties will be in action. The number of points given for draws goes back to pre-pandemic levels after it was raised to eight to encourage counties to prepare better pitches. But, together with the increase in the thresholds for batting points, the new changes have been brought in to put the emphasis on attacking play, mirroring the swashbuckling style England have adopted under Test captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendan McCullum.Bowling points will remain unchanged with a maximum of three available - at three, six and nine wickets down.Teams will still having 110 overs in each first innings to accrue both batting and bonus points.One of the most controversial of Strauss' proposals - the reduction in the number of Championship fixtures from 14 to 10 with a smaller six-team first division - is unlikely to be implemented in the short-term with two-thirds of the counties needing to support any changes.Managing director of county cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board, Neil Snowball, said although the ""principles of finding a coherent schedule is still valid"" there was ""no big decision yet to be made"".""We are sticking with the volume of 2023, most likely roll through to 2024,"" he added.""There are a couple of bits around promotion and relegation, we have those ongoing, but I don't foresee anything dramatic happening.""One further tweak for this coming season will see counties able to register four overseas signings at any one time. Although only two will be able to play per match, it will give clubs some flexibility when red-ball and white-ball matches overlap."

481,Nicholas Rossi: New audio emerges in case of wanted man,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-64582035,"New audio has been uncovered in an investigation into a man who denies being a fugitive from justice.A judge in Scotland recently decided a man arrested in hospital is Nicholas Rossi, who is wanted on rape charges in the US.The man and his wife Miranda say he is actually Arthur Knight, not Mr Rossi.But a true crime podcast has found a recording of a phone call made to arrange a memorial for Mr Rossi, and the voice on it sounds like Mrs Knight.When played the audio Mrs Knight, who is from Bristol, declined to comment to the producers of podcast 'I Am Not Nicholas'.Authorities in the US say Mr Rossi was also known as Nicholas Alahverdian in the state of Rhode Island, where he was involved in local politics.In December 2019, Mr Rossi told US media he had late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma and had only weeks to live. Several news outlets in Rhode Island then reported he had died in February 2020.But on 13 December 2021 a man, who had been admitted to Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital with Covid-19, was detained under an international arrest warrant on behalf of prosecutors in Utah.At a further court hearing in Scotland in February 2022, the prosecution said police and hospital staff had identified the man as Mr Rossi from tattoos on his body.The man, who has been living in Scotland under the name Arthur Knight and says he is married to Miranda, whom he married in Bristol, and has nothing to do with Mr Rossi.He claimed he was an Irish orphan who fled to England as a teenager. Mr Rossi has been charged with two rapes and one sexual assault in Utah.US authorities suspect Mr Rossi faked his own death, and an online obituary for him appeared in early 2020.Shortly after the obituary appeared, a woman claiming to be his widow and calling herself Louise, phoned journalists, politicians and priests in Rhode Island while trying to organise newspaper tributes and a memorial service for him.However, police believe that this was also part of Mr Rossi's scheme to fake his own death.  Investigative journalist Jane MacSorley has obtained a recording of one of the calls and the voice is remarkably similar to that of Miranda Knight.Ms MacSorley was actually invited to interview Mr and Mrs Knight over dinner after his initial arrest in Scotland.She said she initially found them ""very pleasant"" and ""charming"" and wondered if police might have made a mistake, before she then started having doubts.""There was a lot about Arthur's story that didn't add up for me - I'm Irish and his story of a childhood in Irish orphanages was just incredibly vague.  And his accent didn't strike me as authentic either,"" she said.""So I thought from pretty early on that he was Nicholas Rossi. But I wasn't sure whether his wife Miranda was in on it or not. I thought maybe she was. But she also seemed really genuine.""Early on in the investigation Ms MacSorley asked Mrs Knight whether she had made the calls of widow ""Louise"", but Mrs Knight said the suggestion was ""laughable"".When Ms MacSorley later obtained a recording of a call made by ""Louise"", she was struck by the similarity of the voice to that of Mrs Knight.""Everyone I spoke to in the US thought it was Nicholas Rossi using a voice-changing app. But eventually my producer and I got hold of a recording of one of the calls and we thought straight away, it sounds incredibly like Miranda,"" she said.The recording was played to Mrs Knight, who has always maintained she has no reason to suspect her husband really is Mr Rossi, but she declined to comment.The full podcast series I Am Not Nicholas was produced by BBC Studios for Audible.Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

She was conscious and breathing, but was only wearing nightwear.Fiscal depute Trina Sinclair told the court:  ""She was using her hands to rub her upper arms to warm herself up. They carried her back to her bed.""They phoned an ambulance and removed her wet clothing.""The court heard that Miss Norrie's breathing then changed and her eyes glazed over.The staff initially tried CPR but stopped when they realised her notes had a ""do not attempt CPR"" certificate.

491,Man who fled Scotland with young boy for 10 years is jailed,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-64416641,"A man who abducted a young boy from Scotland and took him to Malaysia for 10 years has been jailed.Scott Forbes, 62, admitted flying from Aberdeen with the boy in April 2012, and only returning with him last year.Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard Forbes had concerns for the boy's welfare which led to his course of action.Sheriff Morag McLaughlin told Forbes, of Broughty Ferry, that a custodial sentence was the only option and jailed him for 21 months.She said the maximum sentence for the offence, under the Child Abduction Act, was two years.Fiscal depute Brian Young said Forbes booked flights to Kuala Lumpur without the boy's mother's consent or knowledge.The alarm was then raised.A request for extradition was later refused.There was some communication, but the mother eventually lost all contact.Mr Young said that Forbes' plan was to stay away until the boy was 16, when he would return to the UK to face the consequences.""It was clear this had been carefully planned,"" he said.They returned in July last year, after telling police, and Forbes was arrested on his arrival at Edinburgh Airport.Mr Young said the mother had been separated from her son for 10 years due to what happened, and found birthdays especially painful, before they were finally reunited.Defence solicitor John Hardie said Forbes had acted in what he believed to be the interests of the child.He had become concerned about the boy's mother's partner, the court was told.Mr Hardie said Forbes ""anguished"" for many months over the decision that he eventually took.The lawyer said the boy involved did not feel what happened had any negative impact on his life.Mr Hardie said even more remarkable was the fact that the boy's mother had now forgiven the accused.""She does not wish to see him in prison,"" he said, but he added: ""It's a serious example of a serious offence"".Mr Hardie said as wrong and awful as it was, it had been a decision made with the best intentions.""The real significance is the duration of the absence,"" he said.Sheriff McLaughlin, describing it as a case of the ""utmost"" seriousness, said: ""Custody is the only option here.""She said the harm caused must be ""unquantifiable"", with lifelong consequences from his actions.The sheriff said she felt the maximum penalty seemed inadequate due to the length of time over which the crime was perpetrated and the pain it must have caused.She reduced the two-year sentence by three months due to the guilty plea."

493,Scottish Borders Council proposes 5% tax increase,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-64596885,"A council tax rise of 5% is being proposed on properties in the Scottish Borders.The local authority said the increase was half the rate of inflation and would help to protect services.Council leader Euan Jardine said it had been ""very difficult"" to balance the financial pressure on households with the need to bridge a funding gap.The proposed 5% rise would see payments on a band D property rise by just under ¬£65 a year.The proposals - agreed by a cross-party group of councillors - will be presented to the local authority at a meeting on 23 February.They are still working on overall budget plans but have achieved a consensus on the council tax rate.Mr Jardine said the move was necessary to bridge a financial gap - estimated at about ¬£7m - between the money available and the amount needed to ""maintain services and invest in key projects"".""The impact of this increase on a household in an average band D property will be ¬£1.24 a week,"" he said.He added that the rise would help protect education, social work and the care and support of vulnerable people in the region and allow investment in schools and roads.Councils across Scotland are currently formulating their spending plans with Aberdeenshire the first to agree a 4% increase in tax this week.Mark Rowley, executive member for service delivery and transformation, said he believed the increase in the Borders would be lower than in other parts of the country.""It really is with a heavy heart that we are proposing this increase, but the reality is that without the additional income this will generate then we would have been left with the prospect of very damaging cuts to frontline services with no funding to support community priorities,"" he said.The council is also looking at restructuring its debts associated with Public Private Partnership (PPP) contracts on schools across the region.It said a change allowed by the Scottish government could help to free up funding over the next 25 years to help narrow forecast financial gaps.Tricky decisions as councils face budget shortfallsScottish Borders Council"
